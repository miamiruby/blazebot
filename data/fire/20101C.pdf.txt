Purpose
Operating at emergency incidents poses an inherent risk of injury – or worse, death. The
purpose of this procedure is to describe the Regional Operating Procedure regarding risk
assessment and safety management of emergency incidents. We are committed to providing
the safest possible work environment for our members. It is important that all members
operating at incidents operate in a safe manner. Each member is responsible for their own
safety and to work within the incident action plan to maintain effective accountability and
effective coordination of action. Towards that goal, all members are expected to operate under
the following Risk Management Plan.
Procedure
All operating personnel shall work within a standard Risk Management Plan during all
emergency operations on every emergency incident. This application will be continuously re‐
assessed at all levels of the incident until all units leave the scene.
1. We Will risk our lives a lot, in a calculated manner, to save savable lives.
2. We Will risk our lives a Little, in a calculated manner, to save savable property.
3. We Will Not risk our lives at all for lives or property that are already Lost.
“Actions in a calculated manner” require the following:








Continual use of the Strategic Decision Making Model
Incident Command established
Proper personal protective equipment
Accountability system established
Safety procedures in place
Continuous risk assessment by all members
Uninterrupted Communications

Operational Information
The position in the risk management plan represents the “why” are we taking risk at this
incident. It must be clear to all companies, working at all levels of the incident command
system, that the incident strategy and plans are focused on either savable lives or savable

property. The recognition through an effective size‐up that savable lives may be present at an
incident and that the conditions exist that the fire crews can provide a rescue is a situation that
has the greatest allowable threshold for risk. The questions that are necessary to determine
this level of risk are:




Is it reasonable to believe that there are savable lives present at this incident?
Are there any survivable environments or compartments at this incident?
Do we have the resources and ability to affect a rescue and survive to complete it?

For fire incidents, a quick and overwhelming attack on the fire, from any reasonable position,
may be the best thing for mitigating significant risk an allowing the opportunity for rescue and
firefighter survivability.
If the incident size‐up has determined neither, savable lives or savable property are present
because of the conditions, no or very limited risk shall be taken within a defensive strategy.
This risk management plan is effective and necessary for all types of hazards and incidents. This
includes:





Large scale medical incidents
Hazardous materials incidents
Technical rescue incidents
Violent incidents
