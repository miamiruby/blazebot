GUIDELINES

phone number for all communications between Planning and Dispatch and Deployment. The Captain
in the Dispatch Center will assume the role of Deployment Sector Officer. In the Captain's absence,
the Dispatch and Deployment Supervisor will assume this role.
RESPONSIBILITIES
The responsibilities assigned to the Deployment Sector will vary somewhat in each situation depending
on type, size and complexity of the incident. The specific responsibilities will include:
