Purpose
The Phoenix Fire Department responds to a wide range of emergency incidents. In order to
effectively manage personnel and resources and to provide for the safety and welfare of
personnel, we will always operate within the Incident Command System at the incident scene.
This procedure identifies the Standard Operating Procedures to be employed in establishing
Command components of the Incident Command System and applicable components of the
National Incident Management System (NIMS).
Command Procedures are designed to:







Fix the responsibility for Command on a certain individual through a standard
identification system, depending on the arrival sequence of members, companies, and
Command officers.
Ensure that a strong, direct, and visible Command will be established from the onset of
the incident.
Establish an effective incident organization defining the activities and responsibilities
assigned to the Incident Commander (IC) and the other individuals operating within the
Incident Command System.
Provide a system to process information to support incident management, planning,
and decision‐making.
Provide a system for the orderly transfer of Command to subsequent arriving officers.
Ensure a seamless transition from a Type 5/4 incident to a Type 3/2/1 (NIMS).

Responsibilities of Command
The Incident Commander is responsible for the completion of the tactical objectives. The
Tactical Objectives are:
 Rescue
 Fire Control
 Property Conservation
See M.P. 202.02A for more detail explanation
The Incident Command System is used to facilitate the completion of the Tactical Objectives.
The Incident Commander is the person who drives the command system towards that end. The
Incident Commander is responsible for building a Command structure that matches the
organizational needs of the incident to achieve the completion of the Tactical Objectives for the
incident. The Functions of Command define standard activities that are performed by the
Incident Commander to achieve the Tactical Objectives.
Functions of Command
The Functions of Command include:
1. Assume and announce Command and establish an effective initial command position
(Command Post).
2. Rapidly evaluate the situation (size up).
3. Initiate, maintain, and control effective incident communications.
4. Provide and manage a steady, adequate, and timely stream of appropriate resources.
5. Identify the incident strategy, develop an Incident Action Plan (IAP), and assign
companies and personnel consistent with plans and standard operating procedures.
6. Develop an effective incident organization using Sectors/Divisions/Groups to
decentralize and delegate geographic and functional responsibility.
7. Review, and revise (as needed) the strategy to keep the IAP current.
8. Provide for the continuity, transfer, and termination of Command.
The Incident Commander is responsible for all of these functions. As Command is transferred,
so is the responsibility for these functions. The first six (6) functions must be addressed

immediately from the initial assumption of Command. Use of the Strategic Decision Making
Model greatly increases effectiveness of the command team.

Establishing Command
The first fire department member or unit to arrive at the scene of a multiple unit response shall
assume command of the incident*. The initial Incident Commander shall remain in Command
until Command is transferred, or the incident is stabilized and Command is terminated.


One or two company responses that are not going to escalate beyond the commitment
of these companies do not require the first arriving unit or officer to assume Command.
The first arriving unit or officer will, however remain responsible for any needed
Command functions. Examples would include:
o Single unit response
o Check Hazard
o Any EMS call requiring only one or two companies

The first arriving fire department unit initiates the command process by giving an initial radio
report.
The standard Initial Radio Report includes:
On‐Scene Report
1. Clear alarm.
2. Unit designation/on the scene.
3. Building/area description.
 Occupancy
 Size (large, medium, small)
 Height (assumed 1 story unless reported otherwise)
4. Obvious problem/conditions.
 Nothing showing (indicates checking)
 Smoke showing (amount and location)
 Fire showing (amount and location)
 Working fire
 Fully involved
5. Action taken.
 Assuming command
 Laying a line
 Attacking with…etc.
6. Declaration of Strategy.
 Offensive or defensive
7. Command confirmation with name

Examples:
For an offensive structure fire ‐
Engine 11 to Alarm ‐ “Engine 11 is on the scene of a large two‐story school with a working
fire on the second floor. Engine 11 is laying a supply line and going in with a hand‐line to the
second floor for search & rescue and fire attack. This is an offensive fire attack. Engine 11 will
be 7th Street Command."
For a defensive fire ‐
Engine 11 to Alarm ‐ "Engine 11 is on the scene of a medium size warehouse fully involved
with exposures to the east. Engine 11 is laying a supply line and attacking the fire with a stang
gun and a hand‐line to the east exposure to check for extension. This is a defensive fire. Engine
11 will be Buckeye Command.
For an E.M.S. incident ‐
Ladder 11 to Alarm ‐ "Ladder 11 is on the scene with a multi‐vehicle accident. Give me the
balance of a 2 and 1 medical with three ambulances. Ladder 11 will be Parkway Command."
Follow‐up Report
1. Any immediate safety concerns
2. Accountability started (announce the initial accountability location)
3. Disposition of resources (hold/add/return)
4. Disposition of IRIC (only required if IRIC will not be present)
Examples:
For an offensive structure fire ‐
7th Street Command to Alarm ‐ “Engine 11 will be North side accountability. Give me the
balance a 1st Alarm."
For a defensive fire ‐
Buckeye Command to Alarm – “Engine 11 will be South side accountability. Give me the
balance of a 1st Alarm”.
For an E.M.S. incident – Parkway Command to Alarm – “be advised we have a total of 3
patients, 2 Immediates and 1 delayed. All patients have been extricated”.

Radio Designation
The radio designation "COMMAND" will be used along with the occupancy or address of the
incident (i.e. "7th Street Command", "Metro Center Command"). This designation will not
change throughout the duration of the incident. The designation of "Command" will remain
with the officer currently in command of the incident throughout the event.
Command Options
The responsibility of the first arriving unit or member to assume Command of the incident
presents several options, depending on the situation. If a Chief Officer, member, or unit without
tactical capabilities (i.e. staff vehicle, no equipment, etc.) initiates Command; the establishment
of a Command Post should be a top priority. At most incidents, the initial Incident Commander
will be the Company Officer. The following Command options define the Company Officer’s
direct involvement in tactical activities and the modes of Command that may be utilized.
Investigative Mode (Nothing Showing):
This is a mobile IC on a portable radio, moving around and evaluating conditions while looking
for the incident problem. The company officer should go with the company to investigate while
utilizing a portable radio to command the incident.
Fast Attack:
Visible working fires in houses or commercial occupancies. IC #1 arrives and his/her direct
participation in the attack will make a positive difference in the outcome (search and rescue,
fire control, and crew safety). They give an initial radio report and quickly assign an attack team
(2 engines and ladder) coming in behind them. Next arriving units all stage. IC #1 goes inside
(when in the offensive mode) with a portable radio supervising their crew in the attack.
Examples of these situations include:






Visible working fire in a house or small commercial occupancy.
Critical life safety situations (i.e. rescue that must be achieved in a compressed time.
Any incident where the safety and welfare of fire fighters is a major concern.
Obvious working incidents that require further investigation by the Company Officer.
Combined crew experience level

In fast attack mode, the IC must initiate and continue command until a command officer arrives
and the transfer of command is completed. The entire team responding in behind the fast
attackers must realize that the IC is in an attack position inside the hazard zone attempting to

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Command Procedures
M.P. 201.01

01/18

Page 7 of 38

quickly solve the incident problem. Responding companies must critically listen to radio traffic,
update, review and reinforce the initial size up, verify the safety, welfare, and accountability of
the fast attackers, and back up the basic attack.
The Fast‐attack‐mobile Command mode should not last more than a few minutes and will end
with one of the following:
1. Situation is stabilized.
2. Command is transferred from the fast attack company officer IC to a later arriving
command officer.
3. If the situation is not stabilized, the fast attack company officer IC must move to an
exterior (stationary) command position and is now in the Command mode. The
company officer must decide whether or not to withdraw the remainder of the
crew, based on the crew’s capabilities and experience, safety issues, and the ability
to communicate with the crew. No crew will remain in a hazardous area without
radio communications.
Command Mode ‐ Stationary Command Post:
Certain incidents, by virtue of their size, complexity, or potential for rapid expansion, demand
early, strong, stationary command from the outset. In these cases, the first arriving IC will
assume command and, from the very beginning stay out of the hazard zone in a stationary
exterior command position. The IC must remain there until the incident is terminated or
command is transferred. The tactical worksheet shall be initiated and utilized to assist in
managing these types of incidents.
If the Company Officer assumes a Command mode, the following options are available with
regards to the assignment of the remaining crew members.
1. "Move up" an acting officer within the Company. This is determined by the individual
and collective capabilities and experience of the crew.
2. Assign the crew members to perform staff functions to assist the IC. Staff functions
include recon/reporting, communications assistance; help with tactical worksheet
tracking etc.
3. Assign company personnel to another Company. This creates a larger work group with
an officer. This must be acknowledged by both the original and the receiving officer and
by their inclusion in the accountability system.
Transfer of Command
Command is transferred to improve the quality of the Command organization. When Command
is transferred, it should trigger upgrades in the Command structure. The following guidelines
outline the transfer of Command. Using a standard routine for both establishing and

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Command Procedures
M.P. 201.01

01/18

Page 8 of 38

transferring command creates the capability within the responding units for the IC to effectively
and safely establish and continue command. Using a fast attack company officer IC (IC #1) in the
initial stages of an offensive incident, and then having a subsequent arriving response
command officer (IC #2) transfer, strengthens and continues command within the IAP from an
upgraded Command Post (CP), in a vehicle, outside the hazard zone, creates a strong, safe, and
under control approach. The benefits of an upgraded CP include:






Provides IC #2 with a Support Officer
Establishes an Incident Safety Officer (FIT) (ISO)
IC #2 has a wider view of the fireground
Improves communication
Creates a lighted, warm (or cool), and dry environment for IC #2 to operate in

Transfer of Command process
1.
The first fire department member arriving on the scene will automatically
assume Command. This will normally be a Company Officer but could be any fire
department member up to and including the Fire Chief.
2.
The first arriving Company Officer will assume Command after the Transfer of
Command procedures have been completed (assuming an equal or higher
ranking officer has not already assumed Command). IC #1 is usually a Company
Officer.
3.
The first arriving Command Officer should assume Command of the incident
following Transfer of Command procedures and becomes IC #2.
4.
Subsequent arriving Command Officers should report their location to the IC and
wait for an assignment. The first arriving Shift Commander will assume the role
of Senior Advisor and assist the IC. The Engineer of the CRV will set up the
Command Response Vehicle (CRV) while the Senior Advisor manages the
transition of the Command Team to the CRV. The Senior Advisor, IC and Support
Officer become the Command Team (Incident Advisory Team). The Command
Team may assign additional staff such as a Safety Officer (relieves the Support
Officer’s ISO responsibility) and a Staging Officer.
5.
Assumption of Command is discretionary for Assistant Chiefs and the Fire Chief.
6.
Local events that are of long duration or require long term evacuations may
require a larger Command staff including Planning Chief, Liaison, and Public
Information Officer (PIO). The Assistant Chief of Operations may provide
additional support by assisting the Senior Advisor while a Shift Commander
manages the evacuation and Command staff.
7.
When an incident is so large or of such duration that State or Federal resources
are called to assist, an Incident Management Team (IMT) may be assigned to
manage these resources. In this case the local jurisdiction having authority (JHA)
will maintain Command or delegate authority for managing resources to the
IMT. In either case the JHA retains authority to set incident objectives and
determine when the IMT, State, and Federal resources are no longer needed.
In certain situations, it may be advantageous for the first arriving IC (i.e. Company Officer) to
transfer Command to the next Company ON SCENE. This is indicated when the initial
commitment of the first arriving Company requires a full crew (i.e., high‐rise or an immediate
rescue situation) and another Company or Command Officer is on the scene. When a Chief
Officer arrives at the scene at the same time as the initial arriving Company, the Chief Officer
should assume Command of the incident.

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Command Procedures

Page 10 of 38

"Passing Command" to a unit that is not on the scene creates a gap in the Command process
and compromises incident management. To prevent this "gap", Command shall not be
transferred to an officer who is not on the scene.
Should a situation occur where a later arriving Company or Command officer cannot locate or
communicate with Command (after several radio attempts), they will assume and announce
their assumption of Command and initiate whatever actions are necessary to confirm the safety
of the missing crew.
Within the chain of Command, the actual transfer of Command will be regulated by the
following procedure:
1.
The officer assuming Command (IC #2) will communicate with the person being
relieved (IC #1) by radio or face‐to‐face. Face‐to‐face is the preferred method to
transfer Command.
2.
The person being relieved will brief the officer assuming Command indicating at
least the following:
A. General situation status:
1) Incident conditions (fire location and extent, Hazmat spill or release, number
of patients, etc.)
2) Incident Management Plan. Completion of the Tactical Objectives.
3) Safety considerations.
B. Deployment and assignments of operating companies and personnel.
C. Appraisals of need for additional resources.
3. When an incident becomes so large that an Incident Management Team (IMT) is
requested, Command will not transfer to the IMT (Type I/III) unless a formal written
Delegation of Authority has been signed by both the JHA and the IMT.
The arrival of a ranking Officer on the incident scene does not mean that Command has been
automatically transferred to that Officer. Command is only transferred when the Transfer of
Command process has been completed. The person being relieved of Command will be
assigned to the best advantage by the Officer assuming Command.
A ranking Officer may elect to have a subordinate continue the role of Incident Commander. In
cases where an individual is effectively commanding an incident, and satisfactory progress is
being made to bring the incident under control, it may be desirable for that person to continue
in an active Command role. The ranking Officer must determine that the Incident Commander
is completely aware of the position and function of operating companies and the general status
of the situation. In these cases, the arriving ranking Officer may assume a supportive role in the
overall Command organization.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

The response and arrival of additional command officers strengthens the overall Command
organization. As the incident escalates, the IC should use these Command Officers to fill Sector
(Division), Branch, and Section positions. Command should consider adding a command officer
to any sector with three or more operating companies. Strengthening the Command
organization:






Improves safety
Decreases the span of control
Improves communication
Improves accountability
Improves management and supervision of the Sector

When the first arriving unit is a Command Officer, efforts should be automatically directed
towards establishing a Command Post and fulfilling the Command functions. A Command Post
in a vehicle equipped for this purpose is a priority at all working incidents. A vehicle that
provides appropriate work space for the Incident Commander and staff personnel, lighting,
communications equipment, supplies reference items, and some isolation from outside
distractions will make Command more effective.
Company and Command Officers should eliminate all unnecessary radio traffic while
responding, unless such communications are required to ensure that Command functions are
initiated and completed. This requires the initial Incident Commander to give a clear initial radio
report and continue to give updated progress reports as needed.
Command Officers should stage over the radio. Staff Personnel should report directly to the
Command Post to notify the Incident Commander of their availability to assume incident duties.
These personnel should park their vehicles in a location that does not restrict access to the
scene.
The IC is responsible for managing the incident. The fire department empowers the IC with the
authority to turn his/her decisions into actions (develop an IAP and assign companies). Simply
stated, the Incident Commander outranks everybody*. If a higher‐ranking Officer wants to
affect a change in the management of an incident, he/she must first be on the scene of the
incident, and then follow the Transfer of Command procedure.
Anyone can effect a change in incident management in extreme situations relating to safety by
notifying Command and initiating corrective action.
The Incident Command System (ICS) never "sleeps". The ICS is in a constant state of readiness.
When there are no working incidents the Alarm Headquarters and its Supervisor have the

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Command Procedures
M.P. 201.01

01/18

Page 12 of 38

responsibility of initiating the ICS. When the Alarm Room receives notification of a working
incident (normally via the telephone) they start the ICS process by giving instruction to the
caller and dispatching the appropriate response. The Alarm Room continues in an active
management role by ensuring that the first on‐scene unit takes Command. The Shift
Commander has this responsibility by being the highest ranking on duty member.
Command Team (Incident Advisory Team)
Note: The roles and responsibilities of the Command Team are identical to the roles and
responsibilities of the Incident Advisory Team. The Command Team consists of the Incident
Commander (IC), Support Officer, and Senior Advisor. On the Incident Advisory Team these
roles are filled by the Incident Commander (IC), Support Advisor, and Incident Advisor
respectively. Our system uses Command Team terminology but as previously stated the roles
and responsibilities for each position remains the same.
A Command Team is an organizational response to quickly provide enough command and
control to rapidly bring a significant incident under control. The primary players in the
Command Team are the IC, Support Officer, and Senior Advisor.
The incident scene is often dynamic and intense. As the incident grows into and past the
requirements of a first alarm assignment, the IC can become overwhelmed with information
management, assigning Companies, filling out and updating the tactical worksheet, planning,
forecasting, calling for additional resources, talking on the radio, and fulfilling all the other
functions of Command. The immediate need of Command at this point is support. In some
organizations, the ICs driver (FIT, ISO, BSO etc.) fulfills the role of Support Officer, in
organizations without this advantage the IC may choose to utilize the next arriving Command
Officer as a Support Officer. The IC may decide to assign the second Command Officer to a
Sector (Division) if he/she feels the presence of a Command Officer in a particular Sector will
improve safety and communications in that Sector by reducing the span of control.
Establishing an Incident Command Team
The first in command officer, usually a BC with a FIT, or ISO, assumes command (IC #2) from the
initial IC (IC #1, usually a company officer). Once IC #2 assumes Command the FIT becomes
his/her Support Officer and the designated Incident Safety Officer (ISO) (Note: Some members
of the consortium may slightly differ in assigning responsibilities to the FIT/ISO/BSO per their
department's SOPs). If the initial assignment stabilizes the situation, this is as far as command
needs to grow. If the situation is not stabilized and continues to grow, so does the command
organization. The next in command officer (usually a BC) stages on the radio. IC #2 normally
assigns this BC to a Sector but if IC #2 does not have a FIT the second BC may be assigned as IC
#2’s support officer (and ISO) as described earlier in this M.P.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Page 13 of 38

The IC and the Support Officer are the first and second members of the Command Team.
It is the Responsibility of the IC to perform the Functions of Command to achieve the Tactical
Objectives.
1. Assume and announce Command and establish an effective initial command position
(Command Post).
2. Rapidly evaluate the situation (size up).
3. Initiate, maintain, and control effective incident communications.
4. Provide and manage a steady, adequate, and timely stream of appropriate resources.
5. Identify the incident strategy, develop an Incident Action Plan (IAP), and assign
companies and personnel consistent with plans and standard operating procedures.
6. Develop an effective incident organization using Sectors/Divisions/Groups to
decentralize and delegate geographic and functional responsibility.
7. Review, and revise (as needed) the strategy to keep the IAP current.
8. Provide for the continuity, transfer, and termination of Command.
Roles and Responsibilities of the Support Officer:









Define, evaluate, and recommend changes to the incident action plan.
Provide direction relating to tactical objectives and specific critical fireground factors.

Evaluate the need for additional resources.
Assign logistics responsibilities.
Assist with the tactical worksheet for control and accountability.
Evaluate the fireground organization and span of control.
Other duties as necessary.

The third member of the Command Team is the Senior Advisor. The Senior Advisor is normally
the highest‐ranking member of the Command Team. The first arriving Shift Commander usually
fills the role of the Senior Advisor. The Officer serving as "Command" and the Support Officer
will focus on the completion of the tactical objectives, the strategic and tactical plan and the
other components of the incident. The Senior Advisor's focus is looking at the entire incident
and its impact from a broader perspective and providing direction, guidance and advice to the
IC and/or Support Officer.

process.
Provide on‐going review of the overall incident (THE BIG PICTURE).
Review the organizational structure, initiate change or expansion to meet incident
needs.
Initiate Section and Branch functions as required.
Provide a liaison with other city agencies and officials, outside agencies, property
owners and/or tenants.
Forecast and react to the effect this incident will have on surrounding neighborhoods,
Public Officials, and city staffing.
Prepare to transition to long‐term operations by establishing operational periods and
advising the Assistant Chief of Operations as to the need for an All Hazards Incident
Management Team (AHIMT), state or federal assistance.
Provide a transitional briefing to the incoming IMT if one has been assigned to the
incident.

To maintain continuity and overall effectiveness, the Senior Advisor and Support Officer must
be in the Command Post with the IC. The result is there are three people performing the
functions of Command. They are working as a team to enhance the Command process and
make the functions of Command more effective. The Officer assigned to communicate directly
to Companies, Sectors (Divisions or Groups), or Branches will use the radio designation
"Command” and should be the only member of the Command Team talking on the tactical
radio channel.
Command Structure
It is the responsibility of Command to develop an organizational structure, using standard
operating procedures, to effectively manage the incident scene. The development of the
organizational structure should begin with deployment of the first arriving fire department unit
and continue through a number of phases, depending on the size and complexity of the
incident. The Command organization must develop at a pace which stays ahead of the tactical
deployment of personnel and resources. In order for the Incident Commander to manage the
incident, he/she must first be able to direct, control, and track the position and function of all
operating Companies. Building a Command organization is the best support mechanism the

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Command Procedures
M.P. 201.01

01/18

Page 15 of 38

Incident Commander can utilize to achieve a balance between managing personnel and incident
needs. Simply put, this means:
Large scale and complex incidents = Big Command organization.
Small scale and "simple" incidents = Little Command organization.



The Incident Commander should have more people working than commanding.
The basic configuration of Command includes three levels:
o Strategic Level ‐ Overall direction of the incident.
o Tactical Level ‐ Objectives assigned to Sectors (Divisions or Groups)
o Task Level ‐ Task objectives assigned to Companies.

Strategic – This organizational level is designed around the IC and Command Team, operating in
the Command Mode, and working out of a stationary command post. The strategic level
involves the activities necessary for overall operational control and the completion of the
tactical objectives, regardless of the size or complexity of the incident. This is completed most
effectively through the strategic decision making model. This includes:









Provide initial and ongoing size‐up and the determination of the critical fireground
factors.
Based on the size‐up, define the incident position within the risk management plan
Determining the appropriate strategy: OFFENSIVE OR DEFENSIVE
Establishing a strategic level incident action plan for the incident.
Obtaining and allocating resources.
Deployment of the appropriate resources.
Predicting outcomes and planning.
Assigning specific assignments and objectives to tactical level units.

Tactical ‐ The first management “subdivision” of incident scene organization is accomplished by
assigning Sector (Division or Group) responsibilities. Sector officers are responsible for the
tactical deployment of assigned resources, evaluation, and communication with the IC. They are
assigned by the IC and supervise directly at the site of the assigned activity in order to meet the
operational objectives given to them by the IC.
Task – The level of the organization where the work is performed by assigned companies and
other resources. The Strategic and Tactical levels are in place to support the task level. Task
level activities are routinely supervised by Company Officers. The accumulated achievements of
Task Level activities accomplish Tactical Objectives.

Command Structure ‐ Basic Organization
Incident organization is the function of command that the IC uses to track, communicate with,
and account for resources in order to meet the tactical objectives. For fires this is RESCUE – FIRE
CONTROL – PROPERTY CONSERVATION – CUSTOMER STABILIZATION.
Examples:
The most basic Command structure combines all three levels of the Command structure. The
Company Officer on a single engine response to a dumpster fire determines the strategy and
tactics, and supervises the crew doing the task.
COMMAND
E-1

Strategy
Tactical
Task

The basic structure for a "routine" incident, involving a small number of Companies, requires
only two levels of the Command structure. The role of Command combines the strategic and
tactical levels. Companies report directly to Command and operate at the Task Level.

Command Structure ‐ Sectors Basic Operational Approach
A Sector is a smaller, more manageable unit of incident scene organization. Sectoring is a
standard system of dividing incident scene command into smaller units or pieces. Whenever
there are three or more companies operating in a sector, the IC should assign a Battalion Chief
and FIT to that sector. The maximum number of Sectors that an IC can effectively manage is
called the span of control. The span of control is usually five sectors and should never exceed
seven sectors.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Command Procedures
M.P. 201.01

Page 17 of 38

Sectors
NOTE: Sectors may be assigned by their geographic location (North Sector) or function
(Ventilation Sector). Divisions are assigned by their geographic location (North Division). Groups
are assigned by their function (Ventilation Group). For the remainder of this M.P. we will refer
to Sectors with the understanding that either Divisions or Groups may be used where
appropriate.
A significant problem occurs when the IC requests and assigns additional companies, at a rate
that exceeds the development of the incident organization. In short order, the IC will become
overloaded with the details of managing a large number of companies scattered all over the
incident site. The IC will soon be in the odd situation of being overwhelmed, yet still in need of
more resources to accomplish their tactical objectives.
Command must develop and build an organization that matches the deployment of resources
to the incident scene. The IC accomplishes this by breaking the incident scene down into
manageable subunits called sectors. Sectors are geographic or functional and are managed by
Sector Officers.
As Sectors are implemented, Command continues to operate at the strategic level, determining
the overall strategy and Incident Action Plan to deal with the incident.

When the number of Sectors exceeds the span of control that the Incident Commander can
effectively manage, the Incident Organization should be divided to Branches. Each Branch is
responsible for several Sectors and should be assigned a separate radio channel. Branches will
be addressed later in this M.P.
Once effective sectors have been established, the IC can concentrate on the overall strategy,
incident action plan management, evaluation, and resource allocation. Each of the sector
officers becomes responsible for the tactical deployment of the resources assigned to his/her
sector and communicating needs and progress back to Command.

Reduces the IC’s span of control – divides the incident scene into more manageable
units.
Creates more effective incident scene communications – permits the IC to exchange
information with a limited number of individuals (Sector Officers) who directly supervise
teams of firefighters. This reduces overall radio traffic by allowing firefighters and sector
officers to communicate face to face instead of by radio.
Provides a standard and logical system to divide large geographical incidents into
effectively sized units – allows the IC to concentrate on strategy from one standard
command post location.
Provides an array major support functions – these are to be selected and assigned
according to the particular needs of each situation. The execution and details of these
specific operations becomes the responsibility of the sector officer, not command.
Improves firefighter safety – allows each sector officer to maintain more direct control
of the position and function of the companies assigned to their sectors at all times.
Sector officers concentrate on their assigned areas and are in a position to move
personnel based on incident conditions and the IC’s decisions.

Command Should Assign Sectors Based on the Following Factors:
1. When the number of assigned and operating companies threatens to overload the IC’s
ability to command. Direct tactical‐level control should be delegated (earlier than later)
to sector officers before the IC’s ability to manage is exceeded.
2. When the IC forecasts that the situation will become a major operation, soon exceeding
his/her span of control.
3. When companies are involved in complex operations (Large interior or geographic area,
hazardous materials, technical rescues, etc.)
4. When companies are operating from tactical positions which Command has little or no
direct control over (i.e. out of sight).
5. When the situation presents specials hazards and close control is required over
operating companies (i.e., unstable structural conditions, hazardous materials, heavy
fire load, marginal offensive situations, etc.).
6. Name the sector according to its function or geographical location.
When establishing a Sector, the IC will assign each Sector Officer:
1. Tactical Objectives.
2. A radio designation (Roof Sector, East Sector, etc.)
3. The identity of resources assigned to the Sector.

Sectors Will Be Regulated by The Following Guidelines:






It will be the ongoing responsibility of Command to assign Sectors as required for
effective emergency operations; this assignment will relate to both geographic and
functional Sectors.
Command shall advise each Sector Officer of specific Tactical Objectives. The overall
strategy and plan will and should be also provided (time permitting), so the Sector
Officer has some idea of what's going on and how his assignment fits in.
The number of Companies assigned to a Sector will depend upon conditions within that
Sector. Command will maintain an awareness of the number of Companies operating
within a Sector and the capability of that Sector Officer to effectively direct operations.
If a Sector Officer cannot control the resources within the Sector, he/she should notify
the Incident Commander so that Sector responsibilities can be split or other corrective
action taken. During offensive fires five (5) companies represents a reasonable
maximum span of control for a Sector Officer. During defensive fires seven (7)
companies represents a reasonable maximum span of control.
Sectors assigned to specific operating areas will be designated by directions (East
Sector, North Sector, etc.). Where the incident has odd geographic boundaries (Grand
Avenue) it may be confusing to assign directional designations to Sectors (East Sector,
etc.). An alternate use of Sector A, B, C, or D, pronounced: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and
Delta respectively, may be used (see page 20). Sector "A" would be the front (street
address side) of the building and the other Sectors would go clockwise around the
building in alphabetical order.

In multi‐story occupancies, Sectors will usually be indicated by floor numbers (Sector 15
indicates 15th floor). In some cases, the floor Sector identification may be subdivided into
geographic areas such as "Sector 15 East" or "Sector 15 West" depending on stairwell and floor
access. Functional Sectors will be identified by the function (Loss Control Sector, Safety Sector,
Ventilation Sector, etc.).
Sector Officers will use the Sector designation in radio communications (i.e. "North Sector to
Command").
In many cases, the initial Sector responsibility will be given to the Company Officer who
receives the initial assignment to a basic tactical position or function (north, treatment, roof,
etc.)
As the incident expands, Command Officers will be assigned Sector responsibilities.
Command will assign a Command Officer to assume Sector responsibilities as soon as possible.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Command Procedures
M.P. 201.01

Page 20 of 38

Regular Transfer of Command procedures will be followed in transferring Sector responsibility.
In some cases, a Sector Officer may be assigned to an area/function initially to evaluate and
report conditions and advise Command of needed tasks and resources. The assigned Officer will
proceed to the Sector, evaluate and report conditions to the Incident Commander, and assume
responsibility for directing resources and operations within his/her assigned area of
responsibility.
The Sector Officer must be in a position to directly supervise and monitor operations. This will
require the Sector Officer to be equipped with the appropriate protective clothing and
equipment for his/her area of responsibility. Sector Officers assigned to operate within the
hazard zone must be accompanied by a partner (normally a F.I.T.). The Sector Officer should be
readily identifiable and maintain a visible position as much as possible.
Sector Officers will be responsible for the following basic functions:



Directly supervise work in the sector.
Monitor personnel safety, accountability, and welfare.
Develop a sector IAP that integrates with the overall IAP.

Redirect activities as necessary.
Coordinate actions with related activities, and adjacent Sectors.
Monitor welfare of Sector personnel.
Request additional resources as needed (on‐deck crews etc.).
Manage Maydays within the Sector.
Advise the IC of situation status, changing conditions, progress, completion, and
exception reports.
Re‐allocate resources within the Sector
Provide information for both formal and informal After‐Action Reviews (critiques).
De‐commit companies as operations are completed.

When a command officer is assigned Sector responsibilities the FIT/ISO becomes the Sector
Safety Officer.

The primary function of a Company Officer working within a Sector is to direct the operations of
their individual crews in performing assigned tasks. Company Officers will advise their Sector
Officer of work progress, preferably face‐to‐face. All requests for additional resources or
assistance within a Sector must be directed to the Sector Officer. Sector Officers will
communicate with "Command".
Each Sector Officer will keep Command informed of conditions and progress in the Sector
through regular progress reports. The Sector Officer must prioritize progress reports to
essential information only.
Command must be advised immediately of significant changes, particularly those involving the
ability or inability to complete an objective, hazardous conditions, accidents, structural
collapse, etc.
When a Company is assigned from Staging to an Operating Sector, the Company will be told
what Sector and which Sector Officer they will be reporting to. The Sector Officer will be
informed of which particular companies or units have been assigned by the Incident
Commander.
It is then the responsibility of the Sector Officer to contact the assigned Company to transmit
any instructions relative to the specific action requested.
Sector Officers will monitor the condition of the crews operating in their Sector. Relief crews
will be requested in a manner to safeguard the safety of personnel and maintain progress
toward the Sector objectives.
Sector Officers will insure an orderly and thorough reassignment of crews to Rehab Sector.
Crews must report to rehab intact to facilitate accountability.

Command Structure ‐ Expanding the Organization; Branch Officers
The Branch level of the organization is designed to provide COORDINATION between the
Sectors and Command. Adding Branches to the incident organization decreases the
communication load on the IC. Branch officers supervise and manage a number of Sector
Officers, and report to the Incident Commander.
As the incident organization grows in complexity, and the span of control with Sectors is
maximized, the Command Team (described on pages 12‐14), may determine that an additional
intermediate level within the Command Organization is needed. The Command Team will be
working in a stationary command post (the Command Response Vehicle) and the Senior Advisor
has the responsibility to decide whether or not to expand the organization to include branches.





Strategic Level ‐ Incident Commander
Coordination Level ‐ Branch Officers
Tactical Level ‐ Sector Officers
Task Level ‐ Companies

Branch Officers should be utilized at incidents where the span of control with Sectors is
maximized or incidents involving two or more distinctly different major management
components (i.e. a large fire with a major evacuation, a large fire with a large number of
patients). The Incident Commander may elect to assign Branch Officers as forward positions to
coordinate the activities between Sectors.

The intent of the Branch Level of the Command structure is to split an incident into manageable
components and reduce the span of control. Branch Officers will normally be utilized at very
large‐scale incidents that involve two or more major components. The following types of
incidents are examples where Branch Officers should be utilized:






A Haz mat incident that requires a major evacuation.
A large‐scale incident spread over a wide geographic area.
An incident with mass casualties and a significant hazard (for example: fire, Haz mat,
plane crash, floods, etc.)
Campaign high‐rise fires
Any incident where the number of Sectors exceed the span of control that can be
effectively managed by the incident commander.

Branch Officers manage and direct activities of Sector Officers. Branch Officers operate on the
Tactical Channel when sending or receiving information from Command. The radio designation
of Branch Officers should reflect the function or geographic area of the Branch (for example:
Fire Control Branch, Medical Branch, West Branch, etc.).
When Command Implements Branch Officers the IC will assign a separate radio channel (not
the tactical channel) for communications within the Branch. Sector Officers should be notified
by Command of their new supervisor. This information should include:



What Branch the Sector is now assigned to?
The radio channel the branch (and Sector) is operating on.

Radio Communications will then be directed from the Sector Officer to the Branch Officer.
Sector officers will still use the radio designation of Command when contacting their Branch
Officer. Sector Officers will relay Branch and radio channel information to the Companies
working in their Sector.
Note: When providing radio information to the companies in their sector, Sector officers should
obtain a PAR and insure that all members working in the sector are operating on the assigned
radio channel.
Communications between the IC and Fire Branch are on the Tactical radio channel and radio
designations are: “Command to Fire Branch” and “Fire Branch to Command”.
Communications between Fire Branch and West Sector are on channel A and radio designations
are: “Command to West Sector” and “West Sector to Command”

Command Post (when feasible). In these situations, Command must assign Officers in the
Command Post to monitor each Branch radio channel.
Branch Officers are not limited to Operations. Any of the Section Officers may implement
Branches within their individual sections as needed.

Command Structure ‐ Expansion to Major Operations
Sections
As a small incident escalates into a major incident, additional organizational support will be
required. As additional ranking Officers arrive on the scene, the Command Post organization
(Team) may be expanded through the involvement of Command Officers and staff personnel to
fill section positions. Section Officers assist the Incident Command Staff with the long‐term
management of the incident and operate at the Strategic Level. The Incident Commander
Implements Sections as needed, depending on the situation, and priority of needs (One
incident may only require a Logistics Section while another incident may require all the sections
to be implemented.)
Where the communications system permits, Section Officers should operate on separate radio
channels and utilize the radio designation that identifies their section (Planning, Logistics, etc.).
During the initial phases of the incident the initial Incident Commander and his/her staff
normally carry out these four section functions. The Fire Department's involvement and needs
at the incident scene can be divided into four sections. They are:
LOGISTICS SECTION
PLANNING SECTION
OPERATIONS SECTION
ADMINISTRATIVE SECTION

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Command Procedures
M.P. 201.01

01/18

Page 31 of 38

The Logistics Section is the support mechanism for the organization. Logistics provides services
and support systems to all the organizational components involved in the incident. Command
may assign the Logistics Section its own radio channel. The Logistic Section Officer may
establish Sectors or branches for his/her section as needed.

The Planning Section is responsible for gathering, assimilating, analyzing, and processing
information needed for effective decision‐making. Information management is a full‐time task
at large and complex incidents. The Planning Section serves as the Incident Commander's
"clearing house" for information. This allows the Incident Commander to have a single person
provide him/her with information instead of having to deal with dozens of information sources.
Critical information should be immediately forwarded to Command (or whoever needs it).
Information should also be used to make long‐range plans. The Planning Section Chief's goal is
to plan ahead of current events and to identify the need for resources before they are needed.

The Operations Section is responsible for the tactical priorities, accountability, safety and
welfare of the personnel working in the Operations Section. The Operations Section Officer
uses the tactical radio channel to communicate strategic and specific objectives to Sector
Officers and/or Branch Officers.
Roles and Responsibilities:



Provide Branches and Sectors Tactical Objectives.
Manage Operation Section activities.
Personnel Accountability.
Provide for life safety.
Determine needs and request additional resources.
Consult with and inform other sections and the Incident Command Staff as needed.
Collect and provide information for an After‐Action Review.

If the Operations Officer is located at the Command Post, he/she should use the radio
designation of "Command". The vast majority of incidents can be effectively managed without
an Operations Officer, or with the Operations Officer located at the Command Post. If the
Operations Officer is located out of the Command Post at a "forward" position (i.e. in a high‐
rise building), he/she should use the radio designation of "Operations".
Implementing an "Operations" radio designation in the middle of a major incident can create
confusion with radio communications. It is absolutely essential that all personnel operating at
the incident be made aware of the activation of "Operations". All Sector Officers and/or Branch
Officers must then direct their communications to the "Operations" Officer.
The Operations Officer will communicate with the Incident Commander to request additional
resources, provide progress reports, etc.
Once implemented, "Operations" becomes a forward Command Post. As such the Operations
Officer will need some personnel assigned to assist as staff members to help with radios,
tactical worksheets, etc.

Once the Operations Officer is in place and functioning, the Incident Commander's focus should
be on the strategic issues, overall strategic planning and other components of the incident. This
focus is to look at the "big picture" and the impact of the incident from a broad perspective.
The Incident Commander should provide direction, advice and guidance to the Operations
Officer in directing the tactical aspects of the incident.
