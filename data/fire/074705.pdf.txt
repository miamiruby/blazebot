This procedure provides guidelines for conducting post incident reviews. Fire companies are usually
involved with several incidents each shift after which they could participate in a post incident review.
Participants will benefit most when a post incident review is conducted at the incident scene.
Information will be fresh in everyone's mind and the scene may help to reinforce learning. The Battalion
Chief or Company Officer can conduct a review after any incident.
Several areas will be identified for discussion in each review.

A new form has been developed to assist the BC in being thorough and consistent in the review. The
form should be completed by the Battalion Chief and forwarded to the Tactical Services Section for
review, reporting, and training. The reverse side of the Tactical Worksheet and other review check
sheets are good tools to use in assisting a review of any incident. Use visual references of the scene
whenever possible.
The purpose of the safety component of this review is to emphasize firefighter safety by reinforcing
safety behaviors, assess the current level of safety (measure how we're doing), and identify areas
where safety improvement can be made.
The focus of the review should be on the overall operation, firefighter safety and survival, and customer
service. Reinforce all safety behaviors. In doing so, remember that individual successes should not
outweigh the safety of the overall operation or crews.
The Post Incident Review should be concluded on a positive note. Single company reviews which are
conducted by Captains after an incident or training exercise can be used to chart a company's
improvement. In areas such as safety, the review may assist in focusing on areas a company may need
to improve. Included in this procedure are check sheets to be used as tools in evaluating operational
safety.
