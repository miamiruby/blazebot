Purpose
The purpose of this document is to identify key strategic and tactical objectives in Phoenix
Regional operations in High-rise buildings. These include initial and ongoing building size-up,
appropriate use of the risk management profile, assessment of occupant location and removal,
and effective sectorazation within the incident structure. In the Phoenix Region, a high-rise
building is defined as 6 elevator stops or greater or 75 feet in height or greater.
It is important to understand that fighting a fire in a high-rise building is a complex operation
that must be based on a solid foundation of incident command and pre-fire attack support
sectors. A standard approach to fires in high-rise buildings will enhance our ability for a
successful operation. The omission of critical steps in the beginning of an incident can delay
suppression operations and risk the lives of firefighters and civilians within the building.
High-rise Building Size-up
•

•

•

Exterior view
• Often hide fire and smoke due to building being well sealed and large
internal capacity for smoke
• Determine if building is residential or commercial
• Estimate potential for falling debris and/or major structural collapse
• Guide responding companies around these hazards
Interior view
• Building personnel accounts
• Is building being evacuated?
• Alarm indications
• Stairwell identification
• Number of stairwells?
• Conditions within?
• Standpipe location?
• Roof access?
• How are they labeled?
• Have the elevators been recalled?
What resources are responding?
• Additional alarms needed based on observations?
• Consider a minimum 3rd alarm assignment in working high-rise fires

•

•

Is the building occupied?
Commercial or Residential?
What caused this incident?
• Accidental fire
• Intentional
• Unknown?
How has this affected building integrity?
• Is the building going to allow fire and/or rescue operations?
• Will FD inaction cause the building to collapse into other buildings?
Fire location?
• What floor?

Tactical objectives
Rescue
• Secure and maintain viable evacuation and fire attack stairwells
• Elevators will not be used as a means of rescue in smoke or fire
conditions
• Each must be declared to Command or AHQ prior to making way to the
fire floor
• Evacuation stairwell = stairwell dedicated to the removal of
occupants from the building
• Fire attack stairwell = stairwell dedicated to the fire attack
operations with standpipe connections and roof access.
• Attempt to diminish smoke conditions
• Control HVAC systems to eliminate smoke & fire spread
• Identify stair access to roof
• Rescue of immediately threatened occupants
• Use internal PA systems to direct occupants
• Protect in place?
• Remove to safe location?
• Removal from the building?
• Establish evacuation plan for remainder of building
• Remove fire from the victims or victims from the fire?
• Remove/guide occupants to lower floors or out of building all
together
• Is protection in place a safe option?

Fire attack
•

Assess fire and smoke conditions
• Size of the fire
• Resources in position to make an attack
• Overall elapsed time for set up prior to fire attack
• Provide water supply via standpipe system
• Built in fire pump or pumped by apparatus?
• Stop the production of heat and smoke
• Manage the spread of heat and smoke throughout the building
• Use of building systems
• Sprinklers

• Fire pump
• Secure HVAC
• Use of FD equipment
• PFD vent truck
• Portable battery electric fans carried on apparatus
• Natural ventilation
Property conservation
• Often involve high value occupancies
• Extensive damage not usually contained to 1 floor
Deployment
•

First arriving Fire Department Engine or Ladder Company
• Assume Command
• Enter the building and locate the Fire Control Room or the fire alarm
panel
• Meet with the building engineer (if available)
• Determine if available information indicates a possible working fire.
• Establish Building Systems Sector with a minimum of 1 member from the
initial Company, and preferably a full company. If a single member is
managing Building Systems, a full crew will be assigned to assist the
member as soon as practical.
• Accountability passports from the first arriving companies will be left
with Systems Sector until Lobby Sector is established
• FD Rescues should not take command if arriving first

•

Second arriving Engine
• Secure a water supply and spot apparatus as close to FDC as possible
• Report on scene
• Establish water connection to building standpipe system
• Engineer should remain with the pumper
• Captain and remaining crew will proceed to the Fire Control Room or
alarm panel to meet with Command for assignment, keys, and phone
• Accountability passport will be left with System Sector until Lobby Sector
is established

•

First arriving Ladder Company
• Spot in a position to utilize aerial device for rescue, water supply, or
defensive firefight if necessary
• Brings 2 ½ high-rise packs with smooth bore nozzle
• Captain and crew will proceed to the Fire Control Room or fire alarm
panel to meet with Command for assignment, keys, and phone

All additional operational resources
• After a declaration of a “working fire”, once on scene, all 1st and 2nd
Alarm companies should proceed directly to the building and report to
Lobby Sector to decrease transit time once assignment is made.
• Initial communications between the I.C. and Lobby Sector may take place
on the tactical channel
Lobby Sector will be operating on the Staging radio channel once Command has transitioned to
the Command Van as per the standard Phoenix Regional staging procedures. Lobby Sector,
Staging Sector and Command will coordinate arriving companies for accountability until
assigned to a tactical position in the building.
Sectorization
To assure the effectiveness, safety, and accountability of fire companies, all sectors should
be managed by *full, intact crews. Building Systems may initially be manned with a single
person but will be given a full crew as soon as practical. (Command will not assign single
members to manage sectors to rush suppression efforts on the fire floor)

•
•
•
•
•

*Due to the number of initial activities and communications, a full
crew should be dedicated to the fire control room from the
beginning of the operation. If a single member is left to establish
Building Systems a full company will be assigned to assume the
sector as soon as practical.
Companies assigned to lead a sector should be directed by the
initial IC to report to Building Systems for assignment, phone, and
keys
Manage distribution of building keys, fire phones and floor maps
Manage internal building systems (ventilation systems, elevators,
and door lock controls) and communications
Coordinate closely with the building engineer (If the building
engineer must leave the FC room, a firefighter with a radio will
accompany them
Provide direct communications (via radio or red fire phones) to
stair teams and fire attack companies regarding alarm and
building information
Coordinate communications regarding effectiveness of ventilation
systems between stair teams, Ventilation Sector, and Fire Floor
Sector

Fire floor
•
•
•
•
•

•

Minimum of three and preferably four initial companies
Will establish “on-deck” staging area for companies in a “clean”
environment (minimum 2 floors below actual fire floor to allow
the floor directly below the fire to be used to lay out attack lines)
Announce the on-deck location to command
All fire floor operations will be initiated from the on-deck floor.
Assures attack line, backup attack line and stairwell protection
line are in place and the roof access door is in the closed position
and stair team is out of the stairwell in a safe location prior to
making entry onto the fire floor.
As the attack team makes entry to the fire floor, command will
announce “all units hold all non-emergency radio traffic” to allow
the attack team to make an initial assessment and report to
command.

Manage company work cycles in stairwells and on fire floors
Communicate with all sectors and command to establish effective
support for fire attack
The BC/FIT will assume the fire floor sector from the on-deck
floor.
The BC/FIT assigned to the fire floor will deliver the RIC bag to the
on-deck location
Companies will recycle to/from the on-deck location
Phoenix BC1 should be considered to manage the Fire Floor
Sector when possible

Lobby
•
•
•
•

•
•

•
•
•
•
•

Lobby Sector involves many different tasks and can be initially
very labor intensive. Two crews may need to be dedicated early
on to properly establish lobby operations and communications.
Create lobby staging area for crews
Locate freight elevator and determine if it is safe to use
If safe to use, assign crew members for proper roof escape hatch
preparation of the car, and a dedicated operator
• Elevators will not be used if smoke or water conditions
exist in the elevator hoist way
• If all elevators are down on the ground floor with doors
open on arrival, it is assumed there is smoke or fire in the
elevator mechanical room or the elevator hoistway and
the elevators should not be used.
Works directly with Command and level 2 staging on the staging
radio channel to direct fire companies in Lobby Sector to tactical
assignments
All companies on first 2 alarms should proceed directly to Lobby.
• This allows rapid deployment to sectors from within the
building
In a working fire, maintain a minimum of a 1st alarm of companies
in lobby at all times.
Crew accountability tracked based on assignment
• All crews ultimately should be tracked by Command
Manage lobby level elevator access
Assist with safe egress of evacuating occupants
Work with PD to prevent re-entry of evacuated occupants

Ventilation
•
•
•
•
•

Manages communications with Stairwell teams (Fire Attack
Stairwell team/Evacuation Stairwell Team) and coordinates with
building systems
Stairwell Teams will precede fire attack companies to identify the
fire location, clear the stairwells of occupants, and manage roof
access
Coordinates built in ventilation/pressurization systems and roof
access to maintain a habitable environment, and smoke removal
as needed.
Manage FD ventilation equipment and effectiveness
Communicate with Fire Floor and Building Systems regarding
effectiveness of ventilation systems

Hazard
•

Hazard Sector should be established early with a minimum of one
haz-mat company to continuously monitor O2 and CO levels at
the on-deck location
• Smoke and CO may bank down in the stairwell do the
“reverse stack effect” occurring when interior
temperatures are cooler than exterior temperatures
commonly encountered in the Phoenix area

Fire Floor Treatment
• Treatment Sector should be established early at or directly below
the on-deck location with an ALS company with EMS equipment
to provide treatment as needed to injured firefighters

Occupant Services
•
•
•
•

Evacuating occupants may need assistance early in the incident
Determine residential or commercial

Treatment/Transportation
• May be remote from building
• Triage is key
• Large volume of resources may be needed
Rescue
•

Manage removal of trapped victims or patients from the building

Battalion Chief assignment priorities
*All Phoenix BC and Shift Commander units and both Tempe BC’s carry portable
“high-rise radios” with increased wattage allowing increased ability to
communicate within the building. These radios should be placed in the Fire
Control Room (Systems Sector) and on the on-deck location two floors below the
fire floor.

Rescue Profile
• Most severely threatened
• Largest number
• Escape routes or methods of removal
• Protect in place
• Use of PD in Lobby sector
• Each building is directed by fire code to have an evacuation plan including a
meeting place outside, away from the building
Treatment needs
• Location of treatment area
• Away from building and fire operations
• Resources needed for treatment and extrication if required
• Utilize PD to secure corridor
Fire attack
• Crew accountability
• Stairwell teams
• Immediate deployment to stairwell
• Provide C.A.N. report from stairwell
• Assist in establishing operational/tactical priorities
• Access roof and control access door
• Closed for fire attack
• Open for coordinated ventilation operations
• Rescue or redirect immediately endangered occupants
• Not involved in fire attack
• Use of elevators
• Typically, not used if fire floor is 10 or less
• Evaluate the elevator hoist way to determine if conditions exist that
prohibit elevator use for transporting personnel (smoke, water, sensor
indications, blind shaft)
• Freight elevators are preferable because they are usually larger, service
every floor, and may possibly have a separate hoist way.
• Elevator must be Phase II capable (manual operation inside car with key)
• Elevators must be prepped for use under fire conditions
• Roof hatch opened
• Appropriate tools present including telescoping ladder
• Dedicated FF as an operator

Hose line deployment
• Initial hand line
• Fire attack 1 ¾*, 2”, or 2 ½ (offensive type activity)
• Back up line with 2 ½ with smooth bore nozzle
• The initial attack line connection should be at the closest
standpipe below the fire floor. The back up line and stairwell
protection line should both be connected the floor below the
initial line attachment. An additional 50-75 feet of hose will be
required for the back up line to reach the same distance as the
initial attack line.

•

* 1 ¾ hose lines with automatic nozzles provide 150 gpm at best. 2” hand
lines operate effectively at lower psi’s typically seen in standpipe
operations and provide greater gpm of 250+ and increase stream reach.
2” and 2 ½” handlines also maintain the consistency of 2 ½” connections
for all standpipe operations and meets the NFPA 1710 standard of 500
gpm with two hose lines on the fire floor for high-rise firefighting.
• In-line pressure gauges connected at the standpipe should be
used when available to assure proper operating pressures to
individual hose lines and monitored by a dedicated crew member
to make pressure adjustments as needed.
• Stairwell protection with 2 ½ with smooth bore nozzle
Larger diameter hand line or master streams
• Prevent fire extension floor to floor (defensive type activity)

Coordination of support activities
• Building system ventilation and pressurization
• FD equipment ventilation (vent truck)
• Utility Truck for support of built in Air Standpipe System (if equipped)
• Provide air cart to “on-deck” location for Fire Floor Sector
Crew staging and logistical supply
• Air
• Extra bottles
• Air cart/Utility trucks
• Manpower

Unique High-rise Safety Considerations
•

•
•

•

•

•

The standard BC/FIT Sector/Safety officer will operate in key tactical positions
• Provide for management of communications, accountability, air
management and work cycles in a standard manner
All operations in high-rise buildings must be tied to areas of safe refuge
• Clean environment for changing SCBA bottles
Air Management
• All crews entering building must bring a minimum of 1 spare SCBA bottle
• 1 spare per crewmember initially
• Due to nature of the building, firefighter can’t just step outside to change
their SCBA bottle
• When using stairs to ascend, crews must collectively check their
air supply every 5 floors, managed by the captain
• Areas of “clean” atmosphere must be identified for retreat
• These conditions may change rapidly
• Atmospheric monitoring is necessary
• CO monitoring in stairwells
• Invisible dangerous gases
Stack affect
• Unique atmospheric conditions during summer and winter months
affecting smoke movement inside the building
Building security systems
• Electronic locking mechanisms in stairwells and on floors
• Possibly trapping occupants or firefighters
Fire on first floor or in lobby
• Cuts off the natural escape routes for occupants
• Fire attack may need to come right off Engine companies on street level

Specialty Considerations
• Communication
• Fire Department testing has stated that most difficult areas to
communicate to and from will be fire control room, stairwells, and
elevators
• The initial I.C. must be able to clearly communicate with incoming
companies. A position close to the fire control room is preferred.
Ascending the stairwell is not a good location for the I.C. due to
communication limitations
• Use of portable high-rise radios carried on Phoenix BC’s and Shift
Commanders and Tempe BC’s in fire control room and fire floor sector
will dramatically improve communications and should be placed in use as
BC’s are assigned to sectors
• TRT
• Air operations
• Recon
• Victim removal
• Deliver firefighters to roof with equipment

Initial Operational Sector Setup
The model below assumes readily available resources and is meant to be a template for
firefighting operations in a high-rise building. It provides the initial I.C. a simple plan to
establish the required sectors that will maximize safety, communications, and effectiveness.
Having the listed sectors in place with coordinated communications should precede the fire
attack. The I.C. must assure the tactical decisions made will ensure the safety of building
occupants and firefighters.
First company (engine or ladder)
•
•
•

•

Gives an on-scene report of exterior conditions (further report will
follow once information is gained from the alarm panel)
Establishes Command
Proceeds with crew to the Fire Control Room
• Captain remains the initial I.C.
• Remainder of company manages Systems Sector duties in the
Fire Control room
*Due to the number of initial activities and communications, a full crew
should be dedicated to the fire control room from the beginning of the
operation. If a single member is left to establish Building Systems a full
company will be assigned to assume the sector as soon as practical.
Early balance and additional alarms if WF
• 1st and 2nd alarm companies will come to the building

Next engine
•
•
•

•

Connect to the FDC of the building and leave the engineer
Meets with the I.C in the Fire Control Room for fire phone and keys
Assigned by command to find the attack stairwell with standpipe and
roof access and assume Stair team (designation will be whatever the
building designation is i.e., stairwell A = Stair team A)
Stair Team will:
• Only take air bottles, Irons, and a PW can (No hose lines)
• Quickly evaluate each floor for conditions
• Redirect evacuees to the evacuation stairwell
▪ May need to coordinate with Systems to make a PA
announcement to building occupants
