This plan provides a basic philosophy and strategic plan for hazardous materials situations. All
Phoenix Fire Department Standard Operating Procedures, unless superseded by a specific part of
this plan, remain in effect for Hazardous Materials incidents.
Hazardous Materials incidents encompass a wide variety of potential situations including fires,
spills, transportation accidents, chemical reactions, explosions and similar events. Hazards
involved may include toxicity, flammability, radiological exposure, corrosives, explosives, health,
and chemical reactions or a combination of factors. This plan provides a general framework for
handling a hazardous materials incident, but does not address the specific tactics or control
measures for particular incidents.

Every incident presents the potential for exposure to hazardous materials; even the products of
combustion of an ordinary fire may present severe hazards to personnel safety.
This procedure is specifically applicable to known hazardous materials incidents, but it does not
reduce the need for appropriate safety precautions at every incident. The use of FULL
PROTECTIVE CLOTHING AND SCBA AS WELL AS SPECIAL PROTECTIVE CLOTHING and the use
of all Standard Operating Procedures on a continuing basis are foundational for this plan.
Dispatch
The Dispatch Center will attempt to obtain any and all information from the person reporting a
hazardous materials incident. The information should, if possible, include material name and/or
type, amount and size of container(s), problem (leak, spill, fire, etc.) and dangerous properties of
the materials AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF PERSONS INJURED OR EXPOSED. The incident
taker should remain on the telephone with the caller to gain additional information after entering
the call for dispatch.
Any additional information shall be relayed to responding units after dispatch. THIS SHOULD
INCLUDE THE SAFEST APPROACH OR BEST ACCESS TO THE INCIDENT IF AVAILABLE.
If the call comes from a person with particular knowledge of the hazardous situation, that person
SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO meet and direct the arriving units. Dispatch shall relay that
person's location and level of knowledge to responding units.

The Dispatch Center will dispatch the APPROPRIATE Hazardous Materials Assignment
COMPANIES to all reported hazardous materials incidents.
Dispatch will inform units as to the prevailing wind speed and direction from the monitoring
station NEAREST THE INCIDENT and advise responding units.
FIRST ARRIVING UNIT
The first arriving officer will establish Command and begin a size-up. The first unit must
consciously avoid committing itself to a dangerous situation. When approaching, slow down or
stop to assess any visible activity taking place. Evaluate effects of wind, topography and location
of the situation. Route any other responding companies away from any hazards.
Command should consider ESTABLISHING LEVEL II STAGING WHENEVER POSSIBLE FOR OTHER
RESPONDING UNITS. STAGED COMPANIES MUST BE in a safe location, taking into account
wind, spill flow, explosion potential and similar factors in any situation. THE DOT GUIDEBOOK,
NFPA REFERENCE MATERIALS, the NIOSH POCKET GUIDE, OR ANY OTHER MATERIAL SUCH
AS MSDS OR SHIPPING PAPERS AVAILABLE TO THEM SHOULD BE USED TO ESTABLISH A
SAFE DISTANCE FOR STAGING.
SIZE-UP
Command must make a careful size-up before making a commitment. It may be necessary to take
immediate action to make a rescue or evacuate an area. This should be attempted only after a
risk/benefit analysis is completed. Personnel must take advantage of available personal protective
equipment in these situations.

The objective of the size-up is to identify the nature and severity of the immediate problem and to
gather sufficient information to formulate a valid action plan. Hazardous materials incidents
require a cautious and deliberate size-up.
Avoid premature commitment of companies and personnel to potentially hazardous locations.
Proceed with caution in evaluating risks before formulating a plan and keep uncommitted
companies at a safe distance. IN MANY CASES, EVALUATION BY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
TEAM MEMBERS BEFORE COMMITTING IS THE SAFEST APPROACH.

Identify a hazardous area based on potential danger, taking into account materials involved, time
of day, wind and weather conditions, location of the incident and degree of risk to unprotected
personnel. Take immediate action to evacuate and/or rescue persons in critical danger, if
possible, providing for safety of rescuers FIRST.
The primary objective is to identify the type of materials involved in a situation, and the hazards
presented, before formulating a plan of action. Look for labels, markers, DOT IDENTIFICATION
NUMBERS, NFPA DIAMOND or shipping papers, etc. Refer to pre-fire plans, and ask personnel at
the scene for additional information (plant management, responsible party, truck drivers, fire
department specialist). Use reference materials carried on apparatus and have Dispatch contact
other sources for assistance in sizing up the problem (state agencies, fire department specialists,
manufacturers of materials, etc.).

ACTION PLAN
Based on the initial size-up and any information available, Command will formulate an action plan
to deal with the situation.
THE ACTION PLAN MUST PROVIDE FOR:

1. Safety of all fire personnel
2. Evacuation of endangered area, if necessary
3. Control of situation
4. Stabilization of hazardous materials, and/or
5. Disposal or removal of hazardous material
Most hazardous materials are intended to be maintained in a safe condition for handling and use
through confinement in a container or protective system. The emergency is usually related to the
material escaping from the protective container or system and creating a hazard on the exterior.
The strategic plan must include a method to control the flow or release, get the hazardous
material back into a safe container, neutralize it, allow it to dissipate safely, or coordinate proper
disposal.
The specific action plan must identify the method of hazard control and identify the resources
necessary to accomplish this goal. It may be necessary to select one method over another due to
the unavailability of a particular resource or to adopt a "holding action" to wait for needed
equipment or supplies.
Avoid committing personnel and equipment prematurely or "experimenting" with techniques and
tactics. Many times it is necessary to evacuate and wait for special equipment or TECHNICAL
help.
As a general policy, the Hazardous Materials Team will respond to any situation where a private
contractor is required to clean-up hazardous materials.
CONTROL OF HAZARDOUS AREA
A hazardous material incident has two initial zones associated with the scene, similar to a fire.
There are the LIMITED ACCESS ZONE and the EVACUATION ZONE.

LIMITED ACCESS ZONE (LAZ)
The LAZ is the area in which personnel are potentially in immediate danger from the hazardous
condition. This is established by Command and controlled by the Fire Department. Access to this
area will be rigidly controlled and only personnel with proper protective equipment and an
assigned activity will enter. All companies will remain in tact in designated staging areas until
assigned. Personnel will be assigned to monitor entry and exit of all personnel from the LAZ. The
LAZ should be geographically described to all responding units, if possible and identified by yellow
fireline tape. (A Lobby Control Sector will be established to control access to the LAZ and
maintain an awareness of which personnel are working in the area.)
•

Establish a safe perimeter around hazardous area and identify with Hazard Zone tape.

•

Request adequate assistance to maintain the perimeter.

•

Identify an entrance/exit point and inform Command of its location.

•

Coordinate with Haz Sector to identify required level of protection for personnel operating in
the Hazard Zone.

•

Collect/return accountability PASSPORTS of all companies entering/leaving the controlled area.

Restriction of personnel access into the LAZ includes not only Fire Department personnel, but any
others who may wish to enter the L. A. Zone (Police, press, employees, tow truck drivers,
ambulance personnel, etc.). Command is responsible for everyone's safety.
EVACUATION ZONE (EZ)
The EZ is the larger area surrounding the LAZ in which a lesser degree of risk to personnel exists.
All civilians would be removed from this area. The limits of this zone will be enforced by the
Police Department based on distances and directions established in consultation with Command.
The area to be evacuated depends on the nature and amount of the material and type of risk it
presents to unprotected personnel (toxic, explosive, etc.).
In some cases, it is necessary to completely evacuate a radius around a site for a certain distance
(i.e., potential explosion).
In other cases, it may be advisable to evacuate a path downwind where toxic or flammable
vapors may be carried (and control ignition sources in case of flammable vapors).
Reference: Evacuation Sector, Police Liaison Sector)
NOTE:

When toxic or irritant vapors are being carried downwind, it may be most effective to,
(shelter in place), keep everyone indoors with windows and doors closed to prevent
contact with the material instead of evacuating the area. In these cases, companies will
be assigned to patrol the area assisting citizens in shutting down ventilation systems
and evacuating persons with susceptibility to respiratory problems.

In all cases, the responsibility for safety of all potentially endangered citizens rests with
Command. Once the Hazardous Materials Sector has been established, Haz Mat personnel will
define and establish a hot, warm and cold zone. These zones will remain in effect for the
remainder of the incident.
USE OF NON-FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL
In some cases, it may be advantageous to use non-Fire Department personnel to evaluate hazards
and perform certain functions within their area of expertise.
When such personnel are outfitted with breathing apparatus, chemical suits, etc., they must be
made aware of the functions, limitations and safety precautions necessary in their use. Fire
Department personnel with the necessary protective equipment must closely monitor and/or
accompany such personnel for safety.
BE AWARE THAT COMMAND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL PERSONNEL
INVOLVED IN ANY INCIDENT.
