The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines and responsibilities for minimizing the
effects of heat stress to department members.

Commander, Dispatch and Deployment shall provide an additional ALS Engine Company to any
working fire incident. A Rehab Unit will be dispatched on all First Alarm and greater incidents.

followed whenever the temperature is at or above 105 degrees Fahrenheit:
1. Each member will be responsible to:
a. Maintain proper rest/nutrition regimen
