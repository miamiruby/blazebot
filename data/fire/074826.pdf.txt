Full protective clothing shall be worn by those members operating, or in close proximity to the operation
of the Hydraulic Rescue Tool.
The fluid used to operate the Rescue Tool can cause damage to the eyes. To provide eye protection,
allowing for the event of a hose or coupling failure where fluid could be expelled, all members in the
area of operation of a Rescue Tool shall place their face shield in the down position to provide for such
protection. Full protective clothing should be worn when operating the rescue tool.
NOTE: SHOULD FLUID GET INTO THE EYES, THE EYES SHOULD BE FLUSHED IMMEDIATELY
WITH COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF WATER AND THAT PERSON SEEK MEDICAL ASSISTANCE.
Precautions shall be taken to protect the trapped and injured from further injuries during the operation
(i.e. sparks, propelled objects, flying glass, etc.), and a charged 1-1/2" foam hoseline in place, manned
by personnel in full protective clothing.
The Hurst Tool engine should be kept away from the injured and placed down wind of the work area. It
must not be placed where it would provide a source of ignition for any flammable vapors in the air.
