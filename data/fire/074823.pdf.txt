It may be necessary, under some circumstances, for the fire department to arrange for temporary foster
care for children. This could occur in the case of a fire or any situation in which parents, relatives or
legal guardians are unable to provide care and/or shelter for the children.
In these cases, Dispatch shall be requested to make contact with the Arizona Department of Economic
Security - Protective Services Division. Protective Services will designate the proper location to deliver
the children, depending on the circumstances.
The Phoenix Police Department must be advised any time that children are placed with Protective
Services. The Police Department can usually provide the needed transportation for the children.
