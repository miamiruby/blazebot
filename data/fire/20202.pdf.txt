Fireground factors offer a standard list that the Incident Commander must consider in the
evaluation of an incident. Critical Fireground Factors are determined through deliberate and
focused size‐up with intent of evaluating the incident to determine how and to what extent the
tactical objectives will be met for any particular incident.
Operational Information
The establishment of the Critical Fireground Factors for any incident is done through the
standard process of size‐up. Size‐up is defined as: “an appraisal of the magnitude or dimensions
of an event or incident”.
The Critical Fireground Factors are meant to be used as a tool to assist the Incident Commander
with simplifying complex information into 7 distinct categories. They are meant to provide the
Incident Commander the ability to categorize and simply communicate what is critical within a
specific incident. Not all factors are typically critical for every incident. The ability of the
incident commander to identify what size‐up information is truly critical to the accomplishment
of the tactical objectives is very important. It is equally important for the Incident Commander
to set aside or disqualify factors that are not directly important to the incident outcome.
It is unacceptable to begin operations before adequately performing size‐up and considering
the critical fireground factors. A fire attack is many times an instinctive action‐oriented process
that involves taking the shortest and quickest route directly to the fire. Action feels good in
fireground situations while it can be perceived that thinking delays action. Beware of non‐
thinking attack situations and non‐thinking attackers, they are dangerous and unacceptable.
Fireground factors represent an array of items that are dynamic during the entire fireground
process. The relative importance of each factor changes throughout that time frame. Command
must continually deal with these changes and base decisions on fireground factor information
that is timely and current. Beware of developing an incident action plan and sticking to that
same plan throughout the fire, even though conditions continue to change. Effective fire
operations require action plan revisions that continually reconsider fireground factors based
upon information feedback.
In critical fire situations, Command may develop an incident action plan and initiate an attack
based on incomplete information compiled in an initial size‐up. This may leave the Incident

Commander with significant questions regarding the incident structure, conditions and/or
occupancy. This is defined as critical unknown information. In such cases, efforts must continue
throughout the operation to improve the information on which those decisions are based.
Command will seldom operate with complete information during initial operations.
The effective management of each fireground factor requires Command to apply all methods of
information gathering and communication (i.e., visual, recon, preplan) to each factor. This is
particularly true between the major categories of fireground factors. Command must deal with
each factor in the most effective manner.
Most incident situations represent a complex problem regarding how Command deals with
fireground factor information. There are factors that can be determined from a Command
position on the outside of the structure and other factors that can only be determined from
other operating positions, both outside and inside the structure. During an incident, fireground
factor information is gathered utilizing one or more of the following overlapping forms of size
up:
1. Visual: Fireground factors which are obvious to visual observation and those absorbed
subconsciously. This visual information is categorized as the type that can normally be
gained by actually looking at a tactical situation from the outside. This form of
intelligence involves the perceptive capability of Command.
2. Reconnaissance: Fireground information that is not visually available to Command from
a position on the outside of a tactical situation and must be gained by actually sending
someone to check‐out, go‐see, look‐up, research, advise, call, go‐find, etc. This generally
involves Command making a specific assignment for the coordination and completion of
a 360° recon and then receiving an information‐oriented report.
3. Preplanning and Familiarity: Intelligence that is gained from formal pre‐fire planning,
general informal familiarization activities and from C.A.D. through the M.D.T. (e.g., bldg.
drawings, hazardous materials, etc.). Such intelligence increases the information
initially available to Command from the OUTSIDE of a tactical situation. This information
provides Command with intelligence that would otherwise have to come from a
Reconnaissance report or might not be available.
The following are fireground factors which should be evaluated by Command as they pertain to
each tactical situation. They can be obtained by using the above information management
factors.
