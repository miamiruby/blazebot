The purpose of this procedure is to establish the role and responsibilities of the Occupant Services
Sector.
The Occupant Services Sector shall be established by the Incident Commander at all working structure
fires, and as early in the incident as is practical. The Occupant Services Sector should also be
established at any incident where the need is identified; Fire, EMS, Special Operations, etc.
The Occupant Sector is a critical extension of our service delivery, and serves as the liaison between
the Fire Department and those citizens (responsible parties) directly, or perhaps indirectly involved in or
affected by the incident.
If necessary, Command will request additional resource in order to establish the Occupant Services
Sector. An additional engine, ladder, or battalion chief is acceptable. If necessary, at prolonged
incidents, in order to return fire companies and personnel to service, Command may assign staff
personnel to this function. The Occupant Services Sector responsibilities may extend beyond the
termination of the incident.
RESPONSIBILITIES:
The Occupant Services Sector should consider offering the following services to the
occupant/responsible parties. It should be noted that other occupant service needs may be identified
and should be addressed as part of the Department's customer service goals.

of this location also when passing on this information.)

evacuees. (i.e., affects of shootings, mass casualty, highly visible critical rescue, etc).
Notify Red Cross, Salvation Army, or other relief agencies.
Notify other necessary agencies and/or individuals.
Provide coordination of salvage efforts with the loss control officer.
Where safe to do so, and after approval from Investigations Sector, coordinate a "Walk-through"
of the structure with the responsible party.
Determine the location of valuables in the structure and notify Command/Loss Control officer.
Work with loss control and proper utility services to restore power, gas and water, as quickly as
possible to reduce additional losses through a loss of business to affected occupants.

Provide on-going service and support until the customer indicates our services are no longer
needed.

The Occupant Services Sector shall report to Command unless a loss control Branch/Section is

MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS
Occasionally, the public is witness to a critical life threatening event that can have substantial
psychological impacts on them. These persons may be survivors of a critical event or a witness to a
mass casualty, or a parent of a severely injured child, or a witness to the death of a family member, etc.
Additionally, witnesses may have misunderstandings of fire department operations that cause a delay
in removal of the patient (i.e. trench collapse, an electrocution rescue that is delayed due to energized
contact, etc.). Addressing these issues early, on-site, or as soon as possible following the event, can
minimize these misunderstandings, and reduce psychological effects, and produce improved relations
with the public.
The Occupant Services Sector should consider additional help for these needs. Assistance and advice
on availability of mental health services can be obtained through the department's Critical Incident
Debriefing Team, the Employee Assistance Program Contractor, the American Red Cross, and in some
cases, through the victim's personal medical insurance. Support from the Fire Department Chaplain or
local clergy may also be available.
AMERICAN RED CROSS SERVICES
For residential fires where the occupant has suffered a loss of living quarters and clothing, the
American Red Cross may be used to provide support.
The American Red Cross can provide some clothing, food, toiletries, and arrange for temporary
shelter/housing for the occupants. When contacting the Red Cross, provide the following information:
•
•
•
•
•

Address of the incident.
Address where victims can be contacted.
Phone number of contact location.
Number of displaced persons with information on age, sex, etc.
Fire Department Incident No.
