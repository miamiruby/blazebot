SCOPE
This procedure establishes a standard structure and guideline for all fire department personnel
operating at incidents involving tree rescue operations. The procedure outlines responsibilities
for first-responders, TRT units, Command Officers, and other fire department personnel
responding to such incidents. All other Phoenix Fire Department procedures shall apply to tree
rescue operations where applicable.
PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines for the response of fire department
personnel and equipment to tree rescue incidents. Because tree rescue operations present a
significant danger to fire department personnel, the safe and effective management of these
operations require special considerations. This procedure identifies some of the critical issues
which must be included in managing these incidents.
TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Due to the inherent dangers associated with these operations, the Phoenix Fire Department
Risk Management Profile shall be applied to all tree rescue operations and shall be continuously
re-assessed throughout the incident. A phased approach to tree rescue operations which
include; Arrival, Pre-rescue operations, Rescue operations, and Termination, can be utilized to
safely and effectively mitigate these high-risk / low-frequency events.
Phase I

Arrival.

I. ESTABLISH COMMAND
A. First arriving company officer shall assume Command and begin an immediate sizeup of the situation.
B. First arriving TRT unit that is staffed with a TRT Company Officer should be assigned
Rescue Sector. The TRT Company Officer assigned as Rescue Sector should
remain with his crew. Rescue Sector responsibilities include:
•
•
•
•
•

Assuming technical rescue operations control.
Identifying hazards and critical factors.
Developing a rescue plan and back-up plan.
Communicating with and directing TRT resources assigned to Rescue Sector.
Informing Command of conditions, actions, and needs during all phases of the
rescue operation.

C. Designate a Safety Officer. Considerations for Safety Officer include:
•
•
•

One of the Regional Special Operations qualified Safety Officers.
A Special Operations qualified Battalion Chief and/or FIT.
Any experienced TRT Company Officer assigned to the incident.

D. Following the transfer of Command to a Command Officer, a Technical Advisor
should be assigned to join the Command Team at their location to assist in
managing personnel and resources engaged in the technical aspects of the incident.
The Technical Advisor is responsible for ensuring that the rescue plan developed by
Rescue Sector and communicated to Command is a sound plan in terms of the
safety and welfare of both victim(s) and rescuers. Considerations for the Technical
Advisor include:
•
•
•

A Special Operations qualified Battalion Chief and/or FIT.
One of the Regional Special Operations qualified Safety Officers.
Any experienced TRT Company Officer assigned to the incident.

The Technical Advisor position within the Command Team should be filled prior to the
implementation of any rescue plan proposed by Rescue Sector.
II. Size-Up
A. Secure a witness or responsible party to assist in gathering information to determine
exactly what happened. If no witnesses are present, Command may have to look for
clues on the scene to determine what happened.
B. Assess the immediate and potential hazards to the rescuers.
C. Isolate immediate hazard area, secure the scene, and deny entry for all non-rescue
personnel.
D. Assess on-scene capabilities and determine the need for additional resources.
Phase II

Pre-rescue Operations

It must be determined if this will be a RESCUE operation or a RECOVERY operation
based on the survivability profile of the victim(s) which include factors such as the
location and condition of the victim(s), and elapsed time since the accident occurred.
I. MAKE THE GENERAL AREA SAFE
A. Establish a hazard zone perimeter 50 feet around the tree.
•
•

Keep all non-essential rescue personnel out of the hazard zone.
Remove all non-essential civilian personnel at least 150 feet away from the tree.

II. MAKE THE RESCUE AREA SAFE
A. Maintain awareness of all electrical lines in the vicinity.
B. Watch for falling debris, branches, or tree skirt which can become particularly
problematic during windy conditions.

C. Identify any other hazards that are present and ensure they are secured and made
safe.
Phase III

Rescue Operations

Technical rescue operations shall be conducted under the direction of Rescue Sector by
trained Technical Rescue Technicians.
I. RESCUE SECTOR
Rescue Sector responsibilities shall include the following:
•
•
•

Ensure that all personnel operating in Rescue Sector are accounted for and
wearing appropriate PPE.
Develop a rescue plan and a back-up plan.
Ensure the plan and back-up plan, which include emergency procedures, are
communicated to all personnel operating on the incident.

II. THE RESCUE PLAN
Rescue operations should be conducted with as little risk to the rescuers as necessary
to affect the rescue. Low-risk operations may not always be possible but should be
considered first. The order of rescue from low-risk to high-risk are:
A. Self-rescue.
If possible, talk the victim into self-rescue. Place a ground ladder or aerial platform
ladder under the victim and then coach the victim to climb down.
B.

Aerial Platform Ladder Truck.
Rescue personnel should consider any hazards such as power lines hidden in the
tree, the angle of the ladder, and the distance an aerial platform ladder needs to
extend to reach the victim. When possible, consider removing obstacles that may be
in the way of an aerial platform ladder truck.

C. Ground Ladders.
If it is not possible to reach the victim with an aerial platform ladder truck, ground
ladders should be placed against the tree. The first ladder should go under the
victim; the second ladder should go along side and slightly above the victim. Both
ladders should be secured to the tree. A piece of webbing or small piece of rope
works well for securing the ladder to the tree.

D. Climb the Tree.
If aerial platform ladder truck placement and ground ladder placement is not
possible, the victim must be reached by climbing the tree. Tree climbing with
approved equipment shall only be performed by trained TRT members. Rescue
Sector shall assign two rescuers the task of climbing the tree and affecting the
rescue. Consider that it may be necessary to remove fronds or branches from the
tree to reach the victim and that tree climbing is a high-risk operation.
III. ASSESS THE VICTIM
When the rescuers reach the victim, a primary survey shall be completed and a
determination as to the exact method of entrapment must be made. If the victim is
conscious, rescuers should determine if the victim can assist in the rescue. If the
victim is unconscious, the rescue must be completed quickly.
IV. RESCUE THE VICTIM
One rescuer should climb above and to the side of the victim and establish a point of
attachment for a lowering system. At the same time, the other rescuer should climb
to the victim and attach or “capture’ the victim onto an approved rescue harness. On
the ground, an approved and appropriate anchor and lowering system shall be
established. Once the lowering system has been attached to the victim, the victim
shall be disentangled from the tree, which may include cutting away any system the
victim used to climb the tree, and lowered to the ground.
V. TREATMENT
A. Complete a secondary survey on the victim.
B. Provide for ALS level treatment and transportation to a hospital as indicated.
Phase IV Termination
A. Ensure personnel accountability.
B. Recover all tools and equipment used in the rescue/recovery. In cases of a fatality,
consider leaving everything in place until the investigative process has been
completed.
C. Consider a Post Incident Critique (may be more appropriate at a later date).
D. Return to service after returning all equipment to apparatus.
