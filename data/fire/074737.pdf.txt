PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish standard guidelines for conducting on-site training
fires in the Training Academy burn building, while complying with NFPA Standard 1403. All other
Phoenix Fire procedures will apply to training fires where applicable.
GENERAL USAGE
Any fire department member or outside agency wishing to use the burn building must first obtain
permission from a Training Academy chief officer.
The time and date of the training drill must be scheduled with the Training Academy staff. Drills
involving recruit training and departmental training always have first priority.
An officer representing the Training Academy staff must be on-site for any live fire drills involving
the facilities or the burn building. A fee may be charged to outside services/agencies.
Burn buildings have been designed specifically for the purpose of repeated live fire training
evolutions and include safeguards that only become unacceptably hazardous through misuse and
neglect.
Training Academy burn building shall have live fire burns on the 1st and 3rd floors only.
All non-Phoenix Fire Department agencies must comply with all existing Phoenix Fire Department
procedures relating to live burn training.
COMMAND
One officer on the scene shall be designated as "Command" and will assume the Command
functions.
Training Academy chief officer will assume senior advisor role.
A Command Post shall be established and positioned to afford maximum visibility of the structure,
operating companies and fire conditions.
COMMUNICATIONS
Command is responsible for establishing radio communications with each company officer or
training officer involved in the drill. Channel assignment must be coordinated with Dispatch and
Deployment and all companies involved. Companies operating at the training fire will continuously
monitor the assigned radio channel. All radios will be checked for proper functioning and correct
channel prior to initiating training fire operations.
SECTORS
To eliminate confusion, and provide adequate scene control, all personnel operating within the
fireground perimeter shall operate under the direction of a sector officer. The fireground perimeter
shall be defined as the hazardous area surrounding the burn structure and shall be determined by
Command following guidelines stated in Fireground Safety.

The following sectors shall be established on all burn building fires.
Interior - Company or training officer directing interior suppression activities.
Sector 1, 2
etc.

For upper floors, Sector 1, 2, 3, etc. may be used.

Rescue (RIC)

Provide a staffed, charged back-up line for each fire attack team, in position to
assist in fire extinguishment and rescue of interior personnel. This sector will be
manned by experienced fire fighting personnel (not recruit fire fighters) and each
Rapid Intervention Crew (RIC) shall consist of a minimum of three fire fighters. A
company officer shall be in charge of each RIC unit. There shall be one rescue team
for each fire attack team.

Safety -

The Safety officer or a safety representative will be in attendance at all structural
training fires and will assume safety sector responsibilities. The safety sector will
monitor personnel and fire conditions, and work with Command to ensure all safety
procedures are complied with, and that risk to personnel is minimized.

Other
Sectors -

Other sectors may be established as necessary to control training/fire control
operations and to minimize risk to fire fighters.

SAFETY
The Safety officer shall have full authority to intervene and control or stop any aspect of the
operations when in his/her judgment, a potential or real risk to personnel exists. He/she will not
be assigned other duties that would distract from his/her safety responsibilities.
Additional Safety officers may be assigned to the training fire if the conditions dictate.
Responsibilities of the Safety Officer(s) will include but not be limited to the prevention of unsafe
acts and elimination of unsafe conditions.
Company officers acting as instructors will be responsible for the direct supervision of assigned
students and their safety and welfare, including the prevention of unsafe acts and the elimination
of unsafe conditions.
Fire department personnel may operate on the roof at the ventilation prop to demonstrate proper
vertical ventilation techniques during live fire.
The number of personnel involved in training fires often exceeds the number normally assigned at
actual incidents. To reduce risk, and assist with scene management, training fire participants
shall be formed into individual companies consisting of no more than four (4) members and be
supervised by a company officer.
Exposing recruit fire fighters to live fire conditions presents special safety considerations.

All fire fighters involved in burn building training fires shall have received training to meet the
performance objectives of Firefighter I, NFPA 1001 in:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Forcible Entry
Protective Breathing Apparatus
Fire Hose, Nozzles and Appliances
Fire Streams
Ladders
Ventilation
Rescue
Safety
Fire Behavior

One officer on the scene shall be designated as an accountability officer and will assume the
accountability functions.
To enhance accountability and to improve tracking of fire fighters in the Hot Zone, the
"PASSPORT" system shall be used,
Personnel Accountability Report or "PAR" shall be used at the following accountability
benchmarks:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Any report of a trapped or missing fire fighter
By all crews reporting an "All Clear"
At a report of fire under control
Upon exiting the structure
Sudden hazardous event
Change from offensive to defensive mode
At the discretion of Command

Passports will remain with the designated accountability officer near the "point of entry" to the
Hot Zone. Upon entry, crews will turn in their PASSPORT. Upon exit, the crew must retrieve
their PASSPORT. The accountability status board will contain only the PASSPORTS of those
crews in the Hot Zone. The Hot Zone shall be clearly marked with fire line tape and understood by
all participants.
No personnel shall be permitted to act as a victim(s) during training fires.
To reinforce safety procedures, a protective clothing and equipment inspection shall be conducted
on all fire fighters immediately prior and after engaging in suppression activities. The inspection
shall insure that all clothing and equipment is serviceable and worn in a manner to provide the
maximum personal protection.

REQUIRED FIRE EQUIPMENT AND COMPANIES
Two separate sources of hydrant water supply shall be established (two engine companies
minimum). The water supply shall be test flowed by the forward pumper to insure adequate
water supply of a minimum of 500 gallons per minute.
All fire attack hoselines shall be supplied by one pumper with its own hydrant water supply. The
RIC unit backup hoselines shall be supplied by a second pumper using a separate hydrant water
supply. All hoselines will be flow tested to confirm a minimum of 95 gpm, immediately prior to
igniting the fire.
An ALS company and a rescue shall be on scene prior to the start of the burn.
BURN BUILDING PREPARATION
All doors, windows, ventilation props, and standpipes necessary for the training drill shall be
checked and operated prior to any live fire conditions to ensure correct operation.

manned hose line shall be in position to provide additional protection. The ignition process will be
conducted under the direct supervision of the Safety Officer.
Command shall assign an experienced fire fighter to become "FIRESTARTER." It is the
responsibility of the FIRESTARTER to initially ignite the fire. FIRESTARTER shall also regulate the
fuel load for each evolution to maintain a tenable atmosphere inside the burn rooms.
The ignition of the fire shall be coordinated through Command so the burn rooms do not become
overheated before attack teams make entry.
