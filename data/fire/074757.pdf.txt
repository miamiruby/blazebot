An incident involving hazardous materials has a higher probability of causing an evacuation of an
affected area than any other incident. By the very nature of the hazard, this type of evacuation often
provides very little preparation time. Decisions will need to be made quickly, and citizens moved
rapidly.
This procedure identified the method and resources required to execute a small to large scale
evacuation.
Levels of Evacuation
Experience has reflected three levels of evacuation. Each requires a different resource commitment.
They include: Site Evacuation, Intermediate Level Evacuation, and Large Scale Evacuation
Site Evacuation
Site evacuation involves a small number of citizens. This typically includes the workers at the site, and
persons from adjacent occupancies or areas. The citizens are easily evacuated and collected upwind
at the perimeter area. Evacuation holding times are typically short, generally less than an hour or two,
and citizens are permitted to return to their businesses or homes.
Intermediate Level Evacuation
The next level, or intermediate level, involves larger numbers of citizens and/or affects a larger area.
This level affects off-site homes and businesses and normally affects fewer than 100 persons. Persons
may remain out of the area for two to four hours or more. Evacuation completion times will be
somewhat longer, but generally rapid. Collecting, documenting, and controlling the evacuees becomes
more difficult. Off-site collection sites or shelter areas will need to be determined and managed. Some
evacuees will leave the area on their own or be sent home by employers. Site perimeters become
larger and perimeter security requires more resource. Close coordination with the Police Department
and other agencies will be required.
Large Scale Evacuation
A large or concentrated release of a hazardous substance may cause a large off-site evacuation.
Thousands of citizens could be evacuated. Rapid initiation of the evacuation process may be required.
Evacuees may be out of their homes and businesses for many hours if not days. Evacuation
completion time frames will be extended. Evacuation shelters will need to be located, opened and
managed. Documentation and tracking of evacuees becomes more important as well as more difficult
to manage. Very close coordination with the police and multiple agencies will be required. Site and
evacuation perimeters become extended and require much more resources to maintain. Security of the
evacuated area becomes a concern. In most cases, the City's Emergency Operations Center (EOC)
will be opened to support the evacuation and site operations.

Time Factor Considerations
Time factors are also an important consideration in the evacuation decision.
A rapidly developing moving toxic cloud will demand a more immediate size-up and quick decision
making. Such forced speed of decision making often is made with less information than a slow moving
event. Accuracy of information will also be limited.
The speed of the developing hazard will dictate the speed of evacuation. Immediate evacuation will
require more resources than a slower developing event.
It will take time to complete the evacuation. The more people to be evacuated, and the distance
between the occupancies to be evacuated, the more time required. The greater numbers needing
evacuation will also require a greater resource commitment.
Decision to Evacuate
The decision to evacuate needs to be considered quickly and early. Delays in initiating evacuations
can expose greater numbers of the public to the hazardous product. An unnecessary evacuation
should be avoided. However, once the hazard has been identified and verified, the process of deciding
who, when, and how to evacuate should proceed quickly.
In some cases, in-place sheltering (staying indoors) may provide adequate protection and should be a
serious consideration in the decision making process.
Factors to consider when evaluating the evacuation need include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Product Toxicity (as a health hazard)
Concentrations (before it becomes a health hazard)
Length of Time Exposed
Weather Conditions (temperature, humidity)
Wind Direction (direction, speed)
Wind Changes
Predicted Weather Changes
Distances From Site Requiring Evacuation
Evacuation Risk to Public (bringing them outdoors)
Infiltration Into Buildings
Shelter Locations
Transportation Needs and Availability
Evacuation Time Factors
Resources Required for Evacuation
Concentrations of the population in the area

In some situations, in-place sheltering can be used to protect the public rather than to initiate an
evacuation. In-place sheltering can be considered during the following circumstances:
•
•
•
•
•

The hazardous material has been identified as having a low or moderate level health risk.
The material has been released from its container and is now dissipating.
Leaks can be controlled rapidly and before evacuation can be completed.
Exposure to the product is expected to be short-term and of low health risk.
The public can be adequately protected by staying indoors.

Command may need to provide instructions to the affected public regarding the need to stay indoors
and in such protective measures as shutting down their evaporative cooling systems, and sealing their
buildings.
Command Organization
Once Command has determined evacuation to be necessary, adequate resources need to be called to
the scene and appropriate agencies notified to respond. A central staging area for all agencies should
be considered.
The Incident Command Organization will need to be expanded to include other Sections/Branches.
This level of Command structure may need to be implemented to more effectively manage a large scale
incident. Sections/Branches to be considered include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

Public Information Sector
Geographic Sectors (Multiple Sectors)
Police Liaison Sector
Staging Sector
Transportation Sector
Police Resource
Shelter Sectors
Other Agency Liaison Sectors

Command Responsibilities
Command's responsibilities include the following items:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Rapidly size up the situation to determine the need to evacuate.
Determine evacuation perimeters.
Determine the number and location of shelter sites and communicate the locations to the
command organization. (Use the CAD INFO SHELTERS or the Red Disaster Operations
Manual for shelters and maps.)
Order evacuation.
Provide resources required.
Establish Police liaison.
Order the alert of other appropriate agencies.
Expand the command organization to meet the incident/evacuation needs.
Establish an evacuation plan and communicate the plan to sectors and agency liaisons.
Monitor, support, and revise the evacuation process as necessary.
Evacuate persons from the area of greatest danger first.
Assign specific areas to evacuate in order to avoid duplication or missed areas [use Fire
Department map book--either page numbers (i.e., NE0107) or hydrant zone numbers as grids].
Provide the transportation necessary for evacuees.
Provide continuing command of the evacuation, de-commitment, and return of evacuees.

Police Responsibilities
The Police Department will be an integral part of the evacuation process, as a large portion of the
evacuation may be accomplished by police officers. Police responsibilities include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Provide a ranking officer to the incident command post.
Provide a ranking officer to the Evacuation Sector/Evacuations Branch.
Provide a communication system for police resources.
Provide police resources needed for evacuation.
Provide traffic control and traffic routing.
Provide perimeter security.
Provide evacuation zone security.

Dispatch Center's Responsibilities
•
•
•

Dispatch appropriate resource as requested.
Notify appropriate Fire and City officials.
Notify the appropriate support agencies as requested or listed in standard operating
procedures.

•
•
•

Notify the Administrative Duty Officer and provide a status report.
Initiate recall of additional Dispatch personnel to meet the demands of the incident.

Public Information Officer's Responsibilities
•
•
•

Notify the news media and provide status reports and updates as necessary.
Provide the media with consistent and accurate evacuation instructions as provided by
Command or the Evacuation Branch/Sector.
Utilize the media and coordinate evacuation notices through news media.

Red Cross Responsibilities
Once long term sheltering is identified, the Red Cross will open and manage shelters. Early notification
is required. The Red Cross will need up to three hours to get adequate personnel, equipment and
supplies to the shelter sites.
Some Fire Department resources may need to be committed to the shelters, particularly in the area of
initial opening and staffing by a shelter crew, and later for potential emergency medical support.
Evacuation Branch/Sector Responsibilities
An Evacuation Branch/Sector must be established. On large-scale evacuations, Evacuation Branch
should have a separate radio channel. Various sub-level sectors would also need to be established
and report to Evacuation Branch.
Typically a large commitment of police officers will be required to accomplish an evacuation. The
Evacuation Branch officer must obtain a ranking police officer at his/her location in order to closely
coordinate evacuation efforts. An appropriate commitment of police resource must be obtained.
Evacuation responsibilities include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Obtain resource needed to evacuate.
Obtain ranking police officer for liaison.
Establish sectors as needed.
Provide sectors objectives and specific areas to evacuate (use Fire Department map pages or
hydrant zones in Fire Department map book for grids).
Provide sectors with shelter location and instructions.
Provide sectors with evacuation instruction pads.
Provide sectors with private vehicle routing instructions (out of the area).
Obtain/provide buses or other transportation to those requiring transportation out of the area.
(For large scale evacuation, start with two buses and request more as needed.)
Evacuate those at greatest risk first.
Evacuate the greatest concentrated areas next (i.e., apartment complex).
Consider individual sectors for large population occupancies (i.e., multi-story buildings, large
apartment complexes, schools, etc.).
As individual geographic or grid sectors complete their evacuations, terminate the sector identity
and reassign resources to other developing sectors (for large scale evacuation).
Closely document and maintain records of the evacuation process to avoid duplication or
missed areas.
Document those addressees refusing to leave.

On-Site Notification to Evacuate
Door-to-door notification is time-consuming. In many cases, adequate resources and time is not
available to do this type of face-to-face notification. Use of sirens, air horns and PA systems will speed
the alert process.
When making door-to-door evacuations:
• Be in uniform.
• Wear your helmet.
Face-to-face notification should include the following instructions:
• There's been a hazardous materials incident.
• You are in danger.
• Leave immediately.
• Go to the shelter (location).

transportation?
•
• Provide the customer with evacuation instructions.
Take the following items:
• Wallet/purse
• House & car keys
• Money
• Eye glasses
• Medications
• Proper clothing
• Pets
In other situations, where immediate and rapid evacuation makes door-to-door notification impossible,
use the following notification method:
• Use 3 five-second blasts of the siren while on the "YELP" setting.
• Followed by the standard evacuation instruction over PA system (see instructions above)
• Use maximum volume on PA system.
• Proceed slowly to maximize notification.
• Initiate notification at the beginning of each block and each 50 yards after that.
Once each assigned grid of objectives is complete, report completion to the Evacuation Branch/Sector
officer.
Refusal to Leave
Some citizens may refuse to leave. A few methods of persuasion to leave include:
• Be in uniform.
• Wear your helmet.
• Wear SCBA and facepiece (air hose may not need to be connected) when advising the citizen
to leave.

Ask for next of kin and a phone number.
Write the next of kin information down.

Evacuations follow somewhat of a triage philosophy--we'll evacuate the greatest number for the
greatest benefit. Individual refusals will be left to fend for themselves. There simply may not be
enough time or resources to initiate forced removal of persons from their homes. However,
documentation of the refusal should be done. Write the address down (or if radio traffic permits, radio
the address to the Evacuation Branch/Sector officer).
Transportation Sector Responsibilities
A Transportation Branch/Sector should be a priority consideration for any intermediate
or large-scale evacuation. Not all citizens will have a vehicle available to them.
• Obtain buses (start with minimum of two) and other vehicles that can be used for transportation.
• Stage all transportation resources.
• Put one firefighter (or police officer) with a radio on each vehicle equipped with a Fire or Police
Department radio.
• Coordinate with Evacuation Branch/Sector the pick-up points or addresses of those citizens
needing transportation.
On-Duty Deputy
Any time more than ten (10) persons are evacuated, the Duty Deputy advises the City Manager, or
his/her designee, of the situation.
If the Duty Deputy cannot respond to the incident or is delayed, the Duty Deputy will need to contact the
incident command staff for a status report. Command should be prepared to respond to this request
via cellular telephone, etc.
Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Operations
If a significant or major evacuation occurs, the City's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) will go into
operation. The EOC will collect department heads and senior staff from the Fire,
Police, City Manager's Office, Public Works, and other City departments to the EOC. The EOC's
objective is to use the City's resources to support the incident operations and evacuations.
Command should be prepared for this support and potential policy direction in regards to the incident
and evacuation operations.
If the EOC is in operation, Command must assign an EOC liaison as part of the Command
Organization. The EOC Liaison must have a radio communications link (another radio channel) with
the EOC and a cellular telephone link. If the EOC has a CAD Terminal, the EOC liaison will need
access to an MDT. (The MDT and cellular phones are available in any Battalion vehicle and some staff
vehicles.)

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Page 8 of 8

Responsibilities of the EOC Liaison Officer are:
• Obtain a radio communications link with the EOC (through Dispatch Center on a separate
channel).
• Obtain a cellular telephone or other communication link with the EOC.
• Obtain an immediate status report from Command and provide that report to the EOC fire
officer.
• Provide an immediate report to the EOC on any changes in plans, strategy, problems
encountered, etc.
• Provide progress reports every 30 minutes unless the EOC requires more frequent or less
frequent reports.
• Act as the communication link from EOC to Command.
• Provide Command with direction, policy information, etc. that is communicated from the EOC.
The EOC will remain in operation for the duration of the evacuation. Command will maintain an EOC
liaison and a communication link with the EOC throughout the evacuation, including de-commitment
and return of evacuees.
Return Evacuees
The decision to return evacuees to their homes will be the sole responsibility of the Fire Department
Incident Commander. If the EOC is operating, the decision to return evacuees will be made by the
EOC staff. No other City agency will be authorized to order the return.
Returning evacuees may require transportation. A Transportation Branch/Sector may need to be
reactivated to provide for these needs.
