Attack Teams
M.P. 202.10

11/14-R

12/19-SR

The purpose of this procedure is to give all firefighters an understanding of the Attack Team concept.
POLICY
Command should consider the value of deploying fire engine and ladder companies to build attack teams in the
incident command organization.
OPERATIONAL INFORMATION
In many tactical situations it is desirable to group companies together in Sectors to achieve more effective
results. This focuses the efforts of the companies toward tactical objectives and provides for a more
manageable incident. The Attack Team is an extension of this concept in which companies are assigned on the
fireground in groups to work toward a specific objective within a specific area. An Attack Team is an effective
operational group for many fireground tasks and provides a sound basis for the creation of sectors which may
be built upon as the incident progresses.
A standard Attack Team consists of two engine companies plus a ladder company. The basic grouping of two
engine companies and one ladder provides for adequate water supply and support capability to perform strong
tactical operations. A common deployment for an Attack Team involves a "forward" pumper supplied by one or
two lines from a "key" pumper on a hydrant. In most cases these "Teams" will be created by assigning individual
companies and adding resources as they become available. In other situations Command may be able to assign
a full Attack Team directly from Staging. The Attack Team will either report to an existing Sector Officer or will
become an additional Sector.
During the initial stages of an incident, Command should identify tactical requirements and consider assigning
Attack Teams to Sectors. An Attack Team assigned to establish a Sector should be able to perform as an
effective unit. Command should designate which officer will assume Sector responsibilities.
