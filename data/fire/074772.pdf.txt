SCOPE
This procedure establishes a standard structure and guideline for all fire department personnel
operating at incidents involving water rescue operations. The procedure outlines responsibilities
for first-responders, TRT units, Command Officers, and other fire department personnel
responding to such incidents. All other Phoenix Fire Department procedures shall apply to water
rescue operations where applicable.
PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines for the response of fire department
personnel and equipment to water rescue incidents. Because water rescue operations present a
significant danger to fire department personnel, the safe and effective management of these
operations require special considerations. This procedure identifies some of the critical issues
which must be included in managing these incidents.
TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Due to the inherent dangers associated with these operations, the Phoenix Fire Department
Risk Management Profile shall be applied to all water rescue operations and shall be
continuously re-assessed throughout the incident. A phased approach to water rescue
operations which include; Arrival, Pre-rescue operations, Rescue operations, and Termination,
can be utilized to safely and effectively mitigate these high-risk / low-frequency events.
Additional technical information is available in the issued Technical Rescue Field
Operations Guide.
Phase I

Arrival.

I. ESTABLISH COMMAND
A. First arriving company officer shall assume Command and begin an immediate sizeup of the situation.
B. First arriving TRT unit that is staffed with a TRT Company Officer should be assigned
Rescue Sector. The TRT Company Officer assigned as Rescue Sector should
remain with his crew. Rescue Sector responsibilities include:
•
•
•
•
•

Assuming technical rescue operations control.
Identifying hazards and critical factors.
Developing a rescue plan and back-up plan.
Communicating with and directing TRT resources assigned to Rescue Sector.
Informing Command of conditions, actions, and needs during all phases of the
rescue operation.

One of the Regional Special Operations qualified Safety Officers.
A Special Operations qualified Battalion Chief and/or FIT.
Any experienced TRT Company Officer assigned to the incident.

D. Following the transfer of Command to a Command Officer, a Technical Advisor
should be assigned to join the Command Team at their location to assist in

II. Size-Up
A. Secure a witness to assist in gathering information to determine exactly what
happened and the location of any victim(s). If no witnesses are present, Command
may have to look for clues on the scene to determine what happened.
B. Assess the immediate and potential hazards to the rescuers.
C. Isolate immediate hazard area, secure the scene, and deny entry for all non-rescue
personnel.
D. Assess on-scene capabilities and determine the need for additional resources.
Phase II

Pre-rescue Operations

It must be determined if this will be a RESCUE operation or a RECOVERY operation
based on the survivability profile of the victim(s) which include factors such as the
location and condition of the victim(s), and elapsed time since the accident occurred.
I. MAKE THE GENERAL AREA SAFE
A. Establish a hazard zone perimeter.
B. Keep all non-essential rescue personnel out of the hazard zone.

C. Remove all non-essential civilian personnel at least 150 feet away from the hazard
zone.
II.

MAKE THE RESCUE AREA SAFE
All personnel operating at or near the water shall be in proper personal protective
equipment (PPE) which will include at a minimum: personal flotation device (PFD),
approved water rescue helmet, and approved footwear.
A. Identify hazards that are present which include but are not limited to:
•
•
•
•
•

The volume of water.
The velocity of the water.
Debris in the water.
Hydraulics.
Depth of the water – rising / falling.

B. Assign personnel upstream.
•

Rescue personnel shall be assigned upstream to advise Rescue Sector of any
upstream hazards that may affect the rescue operation.

C. Assign personnel downstream.
•

Rescue personnel shall be assigned downstream with throw bags to capture
rescue personnel or victim(s) that may be washed downstream.

D. Assemble all necessary personnel, equipment, and patient packaging equipment that
will be required for the rescue operation.
Phase III

Rescue Operations

Technical rescue operations shall be conducted under the direction of Rescue Sector by
trained Technical Rescue Technicians.
I. RESCUE SECTOR
Rescue Sector responsibilities shall include the following:
•
•
•

Ensure that all personnel operating in Rescue Sector are accounted for and
wearing appropriate PPE.
Develop a rescue plan and a back-up plan.
Ensure the plan and back-up plan, which include emergency procedures, are
communicated to all personnel operating on the incident.

II. THE RESCUE PLAN
Rescue operations should be conducted with as little risk to the rescuers as necessary
to affect the rescue. Low-risk operations may not always be possible but should be
considered first. The order of rescue from low-risk to high-risk are:
A. TALK – if water is calm or slow moving, try to talk the victim into self-rescue if
possible.
B. REACH – extend an arm, pike pole, rescue hook, or any other such object to reach
the victim and pull from the water.
C. THROW – attempt to throw the victim(s) a throw-bag rescue line or some other type
of approved safety flotation device and “pendulum-belay” or “haul” the victim(s) to the
bank.
D. ROW - If it is determined that a boat-based operation shall be utilized, Rescue
Sector shall assign a company on the opposite bank to assist in establishing an
anchor for an approved rope system.
E. GO - If it is not possible to row to the victim, Rescue Sector should consider putting a
rescuer or rescuers in the water to reach the victim. This is a very high risk operation
and shall be conducted exclusively by trained TRT personnel. Prior to entering the
water, rescue personnel shall be briefed on the plan, the back-up plan and
emergency procedures. Rescue personnel shall never be attached to a life line
without the benefit of a quick-release mechanism approved for water rescue. Rescue
personnel shall never do a “breath-hold” surface dive in an attempt to locate a victim
beneath the surface of the water.
F. HELO - Helicopter operations are considered high-risk and shall be decided upon
through consultation with Rescue Sector, Safety, Command, and the Technical
Advisor. Prior to considering the use of a helicopter for rescue operations, Command
must determine if a rescue-qualified pilot is available for the rescue operation. If so,
the Pilot In Command (PIC) will have the final say on if and how the helicopter will be
used in the rescue operation.
III. ASSESS THE VICTIM
When the rescuers reach the victim, a primary survey shall be completed. If the
victim is conscious, rescuers should determine if the victim can assist in the rescue.
If the victim is unconscious, the rescue must be completed as quickly as possible.

E. Return to service after returning all equipment to apparatus.
ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
I. COMMAND STRUCTURE
A. The first arriving unit shall assume Command of the incident. This unit shall remain in
Command until Command is transferred to improve the quality of the Command
organization. A Command Team shall be assembled to include, at a minimum, a

•
•
•

A Special Operations qualified Battalion Chief and/or FIT.
One of the Regional Special Operations qualified Safety Officers.

Sector. Rescue Sector shall communicate directly with TRT units assigned to the
various functions within Rescue Sector and shall keep Command informed during all
phases of the rescue operation.
