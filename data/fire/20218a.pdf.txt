Overview
Tire fires present the same potential threat to the environment that an incident involving an oil
tanker or a railroad tank car carrying hazardous substances. The average passenger car tire
holds 2.5 gallons of oil. When exposed to extreme heat, the tires reach a state of combustion
where volumes of pyrolytic oil can be produced. This could turn the tire pile into a running oil
fire. Exposure hazards associated with the smoke plume, water runoff, and soil include:
•
•
•
•

Volatile organic chemicals
Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons
Carbon monoxide
Heavy metals

These toxins can be absorbed either through the skin, mucus membranes or respiratory system.
The success of any fire suppression operation begins at the company level. The Company
Officer should familiarize his/her crew with all scrap tire piles located within their area of
response. Information gathered should be entered into the CAD system
Areas of consideration during pre-planning should include:
•
•

Deployment Considerations
It is recommended that major tire fires be handled as hazardous materials incidents. The
incident taker will obtain all available information from the caller to determine what is on fire. A
hazardous 3-1 will be dispatched if it is determined that a tire pile is on fire.
Size-Up
Upon arrival the Company Officer must determine the stage of combustion:
1. Incipient
2. Free burning
3. Smoldering
The incipient stage of a tire fire begins with a point of ignition. Once a tire has gained an open
flame front, the heat of the fire is absorbed by the surrounding tire material. Immediately
separating the burning tire from the rest of the pile and/or applying water and foam would
eliminate the threat to the remaining tires.
During the free burning stage, fire spreads quickly and there is a dramatic increase in smoke
and heat. Use of water in this stage of a tire fire could increase the products of incomplete
combustion like carbon monoxide and particulate matter. The cooled tires may continue to
pyrolize, producing large quantities of oil. A crust may form over the pile while internal
temperatures reach about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The smoldering stage has begun.
Oil not consumed by the fire will leach into the soil, pool, and begin to flow under the pile. Heat
from the fire could ignite the oil, resulting in a three-dimensional fire. Products of incomplete
combustion continue to be a health hazard.
During the initial size-up, the Company Officer has to determine if the fire can be extinguished
quickly without endangering personnel. If the fire is in the free burning or smoldering stage the
most immediate concern will be the life safety of Firefighters and the community. Approach to
the incident should be in accordance with tactics common to other potential hazardous
materials incidents.

Initial size-up should include the evaluation of the emergency in terms of:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Personnel safety
Public health
Environmental impact
Threatened exposures
Extent of fire
Need for additional resources

Personnel Safety
Awareness of the hazards involved in a tire fire can be the best personnel protection. Heat
exhaustion and working in less than ideal conditions is a reality in a large tire fire. Command
will want to prepare for total exposures, health hazards and personal injury hazards.
Full turnout gear is the minimum level of protection required for everyone working the tire fire.
1. Boots
2. Turnout pants
3. Turnout coat
4. Gloves
5. Helmet
6. Nomex hood
7. S.C.B.A. with Mask
NOTE: Conditions permitting E.M.S. gloves under the leather gloves will give added protection
from contact with the contaminated water, oil, and mud.
The risk of exposure to toxic chemicals continues after the fire is out. Smoldering tires are as
toxic as tires in a free burning state. Flying ash and contaminated soil are also potential hazards.
The temptation to dress down for overhaul should be resisted until the hazardous materials
team has determined the appropriate level of protective clothing required.
Command will establish a Lobby Sector to ensure personnel accountability. When multiple
points of entry to the incident exist, geographic sectors should be established (e.g., lobby north,
lobby east, etc.). Hazard sectors, zones and Rehab Sector will be established according to the
Standard Operating Procedures.
The Incident Commander will establish a Decontamination Sector for all personnel leaving the

fire area. All protective clothing, firefighting equipment and apparatus will need to be
decontaminated as well.
Sectors such as environmental, safety, PIO and any other sectors/branches listed under
"Command Concerns" in this procedure will be established as the incident progresses.
Personnel must be aware of other hazards involving scrap tire fires. Contact with rodents,
mosquitoes, snakes, spiders and scorpions will be reduced with protective clothing.
Be aware of the dangers of machinery and heavy equipment operating on the fire scene.
Collapsing walls of tires can block escape routes or cut off water supplies.
Public Health
Command should determine early whether to evacuate the surrounding areas. Tire fires are
extremely difficult to extinguish. Given this knowledge, no strategy for managing the incident
should bypass evacuation considerations.
Evacuation Sector should be established early. The process will be managed according to the
Evacuation Sector procedure (M.P. 201.05E).
Environmental Impact
Command should size-up the potential environmental consequences of the fire and begin
notifying the appropriate agencies. Emergency contacts can be notified according to the
Environmental Sector procedure (M.P. 201.05D). Early notification will facilitate their timely
placement into the Command structure and involvement in the incident.

Areas of concern will include:

Tactics
Important tactical considerations include:
•
•
•

Life safety
Protecting exposures
Isolating burning tires
Use of heavy equipment
Overhead or underground utilities

Immediate evacuation of the incident scene is a high priority. Every effort should address life
safety of the incident scene. Protection of the fire crews safety will be addressed continuously.
On-deck crews will be established according to the In-Transit, On Deck, Company Recycle
procedure (M.P. 201.01A). Buildings, equipment and utilities in the proximity of the fire will
need to be protected. Command needs to determine the amount of fuel actively burning and
the total amount of fuel available. Estimate the rate of spread to determine what will be
allowed to burn and where fire breaks will be cut through the pile.
Creating fire breaks in a large tire pile is a long and time consuming process. It can be
accomplished with heavy machinery and front-end loaders. Use of City Equipment at
Emergency Scenes procedure will allow Command to implement the process (M.P. 206.15).

Page 6 of 8

Successful options for fighting a tire fire have been employed individually and in many cases, in
combination with one another. Reduced to the lowest common denominator, these options
are:
1. Burn it
2. Bury it
3. Drown it
Burn It
Letting a tire pile burn has its merits. Soil and water pollution may be drastically reduced
when many of the products of combustion go up in smoke. The clean up costs can be
reduced when compared to other options.
A precedent for the burn it strategy appears in fire responses to chemical fires. Adding
water to fires or hazardous materials which react to water could exacerbate the
emergency.
Importantly, the fire service must manage and control the burn. Protecting exposures
and separating tires from the burn area will continue to be a tactical priority.
Bury It
The decision to bury a tire pile also has merits. Sand, cement dust, quick lime, and
crushed coral rock are all high in calcium content. Calcium scrubs sulfur from the
emissions, creating calcium sulfate or gypsum.
The bury it strategy could be employed in areas that have minimal water supply or in
areas that are densely populated. The decision to bury a tire fire would take into
consideration reducing toxic smoke for the sake of public health.
Geological considerations play an important role in the bury it strategy. While the tire
fire is entombed, fires can still pyrolize and push toxic oil into the soil and underground
water sources. Burying a tire fire that is on top of clay soils may delay the oil from
filtering to underground water supplies. To determine the release of pyrolytic oil, check
down gradient from the pile for contamination.
Drown It

PHOENIX REGIONAL

Water, foam, and additives have their own place as an option. The drown it strategy is
best employed with forethought and careful pre-planning. Knowing in advance the
topography and exposure hazards to water sources will be critical.
Drawbacks to the drown it strategy include:
•
•
•

An increase in the toxic air emissions as the fire is cooled causing the combustion
process to slow down.
An inordinate amount of water run-off combined with pyrolytic oil will be the
result of trying to drown out a fire.
Effectiveness of working lines applied to a tire fire is questionable. Handlines
alone cannot reach the interior spaces of a tire fire.

The use of working lines on chunk and chipped tires, however, can be effective when used in a
fog application. Here again, separating the inventory from the burn area is important to the
control and extinguishment of chipped and chunk tire materials.
The use of foam would best be employed on small tire fires or when the fire is in the incipient
stage. Pulling a larger tire pile apart with heavy machinery and applying foam would be a
prudent use of the product. Foam should only be employed as part of a predetermined
strategy.
Clean-Up and Overhaul
Unlike traditional structural fires or wildland fires, clean-up on tire fires will; in all probability,
be turned over to an appropriate environmental protection agency. Hazards to personnel exist
long after the fire is out. Toxicity levels of tire fire sites suggest high concentrations of
contaminates. Flying ash and contaminated soil blown around the site may increase your
exposure risks.
