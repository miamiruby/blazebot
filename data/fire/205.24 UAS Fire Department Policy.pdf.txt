PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide members of the Phoenix Fire Department (PFD) a
set of operational guidelines intended to promote the safe, efficient, and lawful operation of
Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). This document identifies the responsibilities, requirements,
and operations of the department’s UAS program.
The PFD’s primary purpose for integrating UAS technology into its initial hazard mitigation
deployment model is to increase the Incident Commander’s (“IC”) “situational awareness” by
providing a unique aerial perspective that assists the IC in fully understanding the challenges of
a given incident in “real time”; thus, providing critical information necessary to guide decisionmaking. Ultimately, those decisions impact the risk exposed to firefighters and equipment.

POLICY
It shall be the policy of the Phoenix Fire Department to use UAS to enhance the Department’s
mission of protecting lives and property. Any use of UAS will be in strict accordance with
federal, state, and local laws, including compliance with constitutional and privacy rights, FAA
regulations and City policy.

DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS
Above Ground Level (AGL): AGL is the altitude expressed in the actual number of feet
measured above the ground.
Air Traffic Control (ATC): Manages traffic from the airport to a radius of 3 to 30 miles.
Provides pilots taxiing and take off instructions, air traffic clearance, and advice based on their
own observations and experience. Maintains separation between landing and departing
aircraft, transfers control of aircraft to the enroute center controllers when the aircraft leave
their airspace and receives control of aircraft on flights coming into their airspace.
Beyond Visual Line of Site (BVLOS): the operation of UAVs (unmanned Aircraft vehicles) at
distances outside the Visual Line of Site (VLOS), as defined herein.
Certificate of Authorization (COA): Issued by the FAA and grants permission to fly within
specific boundaries and parameters.
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA): Federal agency in the United States and part of the
Department of Transportation. The FAA regulates U.S. civil aviation, U.S. commercial space
transportation, operates control towers, builds, installs, and maintains electronic aids to
navigation, and registers all pilots and aircrafts in the United States.
National Airspace System (NAS): The NAS is made up of a network of air navigation facilities,
ATC facilities, airports, technology, and appropriate rules and regulations that are needed to
operate the system.

Navigable Airspace: FAA controlled airspace classified as: A, B, C, D, E, and G.
Notice to Airmen (NOTAM): A NOTAM is time critical information concerning the establishment,
condition, or change in any component in the National Air Space (NAS). The NOTAM provides
knowledge that is essential to personnel concerned with flight operations in designated areas.
NOTAMs may be filed as a temporary change to the NAS as they were not known in advance to
publish on aeronautical charts or other operational publications.
Personal Identifying Information: For purposes of this policy, this includes a person’s date of
birth, social security number, personal telephone number, home address, personal email
address, and official state or government-issued driver’s license or identification number.
Remote Pilot-in-Command (RPIC): Person who has final authority and responsibility for the
operation and safety of flight, has been designated as the RPIC before or during the flight, and
holds the appropriate category, class and type rating, if applicable, for the conduct of the flight.
Pilots are authorized to evaluate and accept or decline any mission or portion thereof due to
safety concerns.
Person Manipulating the Controls: A person who is manipulating the UAV flight controls but
does not have an FAA 107 certification. The RPIC must be able to take over control of the UAV
from the person manipulating the controls, in case of emergency. This can be done by standing
close enough to physically take the controller, by using a secondary controller, or use of a preprogramed safe-mode system.
Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle (UAV): A powered, aerial vehicle that uses aerodynamic forces to
provide vehicle lift, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, and can be expendable or
recoverable. Refers more specifically to the unmanned aircraft vehicle itself.
Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS): Consists of an unmanned aircraft weighing less than 55 lbs.,
the command system, a secure control link, camera, and other related safety support
equipment, including ground control base stations and specialty vehicles designed to support
unmanned flight operations.
Unmanned Aircraft System Crewmember: A Pilot in Command, Visual Observer, or other
persons assigned UAS duties for the purpose of flight.
Visual Line of Sight (VLOS): Visual contact between RPIC or VO and a UAS sufficient to
maintain safe operational control of the aircraft, known location, and be able to scan the
airspace in which it is operating to see and avoid other aircraft or objects aloft or on the ground.
Visual Observer (VO): The Visual Observer is for the visual observation of the UAV while inflight. The VO shall alert the PIC of any conditions (obstructions, terrain, structures, air traffic,
weather, etc.) that may affect the safety of flight.

SCOPE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide the process and procedures for the operations and
management of any small UAS used by the PFD. It will detail the conditions under which the PFD
will utilize UAS technology to maximize efficiency and cost savings while minimizing risk to first
responders, equipment, and the community.
UAS program development is focused on strategic and tactical support of (a) emergency service
delivery, (b) planned events, (c) investigations, and (d) training.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Pursuant to ARS § 13-3729(D)(2), the city may enact or adopt ordinances or rules on the
operation or use of a public unmanned aircraft that is owned by the city. Under this statute “a
public unmanned aircraft” means an unmanned aircraft or unmanned aircraft system that is
operated by the city for a government-related purpose. ARS § 13-3729(F)(6). Per Section 2449(B)(3) of the Phoenix City Code, PFD is exempt from the operational restrictions when
remotely controlled aircraft, unmanned aircraft vehicles, and unmanned aircraft systems are
used for Fire Department purposes.
4th Amendment Protections, Privacy and Civil Liberties
It is the policy of the City of Phoenix that the operation of the UAS and all UAVs shall be carried out
in a manner that respects and protects personal privacy consistent with the United States
Constitution and Federal, State, and local law. The impact on privacy and civil liberties shall be
balanced against the governmental interests leading to a deployment. The Phoenix Fire
Department will only collect information and use, retain, or disseminate information obtained for a
properly authorized purpose.
The Phoenix Fire Department prohibits the collection, use, retention, or dissemination of UAS
collected information in any manner that would:
a. Be used or operated to violate a person’s reasonable expectation of privacy, if a warrant has
not been obtained, there is no exigency, and/or there is no consent. Some factors to include
that may create a reasonable expectation of privacy are: (1) the location is not open to public
use; (2) the location is privately owned, and the person on the property has the right to
control access to the location and exclude others; and (3) the location is one where the
owner has taken normal precautions to maintain privacy. A person does not have a
reasonable expectation of privacy out in public or openly accessible places, or in places that
can be viewed by the normal eye.
b. Involve prolonged or extensive tracking or surveillance, over a lengthy period of time, that
reveals non-public information, without obtaining a warrant, in violation of a person’s Fourth
Amendment protections. When a person can conduct surveillance with authority or a
warrant, a UAV or UAS can also conduct the surveillance.

manual.
This procedure has been written to address PFD UAS operations. This procedure will be reviewed
and updated periodically, or any time the FAA issues a new advisory or new regulation. Any
changes to the manual will be communicated as currently dictated by PFD policy. A copy of these
guidelines and any updates to them will be issued to each person having UAS responsibilities and
will be posted on the shared drive so all PFD personnel may access it.
AUTHORIZED DEPARTMENTAL USE of UAS
The primary role of the UAS is insertion into emergent or ongoing events that pose a risk to public
safety or threats to the City’s infrastructure by providing “real time” hazard assessment utilizing
High Resolution (zoom capable) cameras and Infrared/Thermal Sensors.
Although not meant to be “all inclusive” or exclusive of any emergent incident type, the
following are primary scenarios under which a PFD UAS can be requested, deployed and
utilized:

Structure Fires - Deployment of UAS to structure fires, in particular, buildings suspected of
structural compromise, i.e. roof, walls or other structural components. UAS will be utilized
during the initial action phase as well as the extinguishment and overhaul phase of an incident.

Mountain Rescue - Deployment of UAS into mountain preserve areas to verify the existence and
location of lost or injured persons and confirm the safest and most effective means of
dispatching department technical rescue teams to make patient contact and extract them from
the area.

Hazardous Material Operations - Deployment of UAS with dual high definition / Infrared
camera capabilities to identify HAZ-MAT products or concerns, containment areas,
thermal readings, and amount of product. Reduce incident time and exposure to
personnel through UAS information gathering.

Brush Fire Operations - Deployment of UAS within the City of Phoenix urban interface areas for
the purpose of developing hazard mitigation strategies, i.e., structure defense, perimeter control
(hot spots) and containment assessment. 3D brush mapping through autonomous mapping
flights. Under NO circumstances will a UAS be operated while manned aircraft are in operation.

Planned Training Events - The use of UAS during planned training exercises are intended to
simulate the safe and proficient incorporation of UAS technology during real world
deployment.

Non-emergent operations – UAS can be utilized for non-emergent use such as Fire
Investigation, Safety, PIO, Preplanning, Inspections, and Training.

Prohibited uses may include, but are not limited to the following:
•

General Surveillance: Monitor members of the public or provide surveillance
for law enforcement purposes.

•

Lending Equipment: The UAS will NOT be lent to any other department or agency.
However, if dispatched or properly requested, the UAS, operated by PFD UAS team
members, can be utilized in accordance with the provisions of the Department UAS Policy
and applicable COA, to assist Automatic Aid and/or Mutual Aid partners.

•

Exceeding Aircraft Limitations: The UAS shall not be used in a manner contrary to the
manufacturer’s guidelines or specifications.

•

Personal business: The UAS shall not be used to conduct any personal business other
than official department business.

•

High Risk Missions: UAS will not be flown for any mission during which the PIC
determines the risk of flying outweighs the benefit to the mission. Risks may include
hazards to individuals or property, possible collision hazards, and/or loss of control of the
UAS.

•

No Fly Zones/”No Drone Zones”: Certain FAA rules prohibit or restrict UAS operations
including, without limitation, (a) within a five (5) mile radius of an airport; (b) national
parks, monuments, and landmarks; (c) federal military bases; (d) federal prisons; (e)
near, or over wildfires; (f) in, and around stadiums one (1) hour before and (1) hour after
an event; and (g) nuclear power plants. If the PFD determines it is necessary to operate
UAS in a No-Fly Zone, FAA or other appropriate authorization will be obtained prior to
UAS deployment. The PFD will actively pursue a Certificate of Authorization from the

FAA to grant special permission to operate within the various classes of Controlled
airspace in the Phoenix Metro Area.
•

Height Restrictions: Per the FAA, UAS may not fly more than 400 feet above the
ground or higher if the UAV remains within 400 feet of a building or other structure.

•

Use of UAS to spray, drop, or carry any chemicals or hazardous materials, and carrying
weapons of any type or category.

•

Manned Aircraft in Operating Area: UAS flights are prohibited when other governmental
aircraft are in the area, unless coordinated flight training has occurred with that agency.

• Beyond Visual Line of Sight: All BVLOS missions are prohibited. The UAV must be kept
within VLOS. Alternatively, if First Person View or similar technology is used, a visual
observer must always keep the UAV within unaided sight (for example, no binoculars).
However, the PIC must keep the UAV close enough to be able to see it if something

completed the departments Visual Observer course.
The VO is equally responsible for the visual observation of the UAS while in flight and
to alert the PIC of any conditions (obstructions, terrain, structures, air traffic, weather,
etc.), which may affect the safety of a flight.
The VO’s added function is to coordinate and communicate operations between the
Pilot-in- Command (PIC) and the IC or their designee.
The VO will be responsible for all aviation related communications required by Federal
Aviation Regulations (FARs). To accomplish this, the observer should be in close
proximity and have constant communication, via radio or face-to-face, with the PIC to
ensure instant relaying of information.

UAS Teams
PFD UAS Teams consist of a pilot (RPIC) and a visual observer (VO) when possible. A
visual observer is required for night flights. The team concept is established to train for
and respond to each authorized UAS mission.
Each UAS Team will, whenever possible, operate with two (2) members of the Department
(pilot-in-command and visual observer). Each member will be assigned a specific role prior to
flight. Additional team members may be needed for complex missions.
TRAINING

Instructors:
The Primary instructor(s) will be chosen by the Program Manager. These pilots will be chosen
based on UAS experience and operational knowledge withing the National Airspace. Through
training modules approved by the UAS Program Manager, the UAS Coordinator will coordinate
training based on the needs of the program. Duties of instructing new members shall fall upon
those who have the most flight time and knowledge of UAS operations. Instructors will be
designated based on experience and competency with the UAS operation and approved by the
UAS program Manager.

Training Policies:
All members will have access to the monthly and yearly training plan. Training plans will be
developed jointly by the PFD’s UAS Program Manager and the Training Division and will be
implemented by approved UAS instructors.
All deployments and/or exercises will be documented and will count toward a member’s
training. A third-party program management software will help track pilot logs and flight
hours with each specific UAS platform. Each member of the UAS program has the
responsibility to maintain their own training file and ensure the information is up-to-date,
accurate and complete.

Should a pilot decline a mission, the pilot must make a written declaration outlining the
reason(s) why the mission was not accepted and submit the draft to the Program Manager
where it will be reviewed and forwarded to the Homeland Chief.
SAFETY POLICY
If any UAS Team member observes or has knowledge of an unsafe or dangerous act within the
UAS Program shall be communicated to the Program Coordinator immediately.
Management will not initiate disciplinary action against personnel who, in good faith, disclose
a hazard or safety occurrence due to unintentional conduct.
It is the duty of every UAS Team member involved in any UAS flight to contribute to the goal of
continued safe operations. Any safety hazard, whether procedural, operational, or maintenance
related should be identified as soon as possible.
Conduct regular audits of safety policies, procedures, and practices.
Monitor the UAS community to ensure best safety practices are incorporated into the organization.
GROUND SAFETY
•

The UAS Team will identify and secure a safe location within the operational area
for UAS launch and recovery.

•

Only mission essential personnel will be in proximity to UAS launch and recovery
activities. When operating near populated areas, the pilot will ensure that a “defined
incident perimeter” exists to limit the potential of persons being present beneath the
UAS flight path.
The pilot and Visual Observer must always be aware of dangers to ground personnel
from moving rotors.
The pilot shall under no circumstances leave any unauthorized person in charge of
the UAS controls while the UAS is running.
If it is necessary for the pilot to leave the controls of the UAS, the engine will be shut

down, battery removed, and the controls deactivated.
A pre-flight checklist pertinent to the specific UAS to be flown will be utilized to
perform the required checks and risk assessment.

WEATHER
Before launch, a thorough check of the weather will be conducted, and all members of the
flight team will be made aware of the findings.
Weather information can be obtained through two primary means
• FAA approved weather resources
• An anemometer

*Pilots will not fly in wind or temperatures outside of the manufacture’s recommendations.*
Weather information obtained during the pre-flight phase will be documented in the flight log.
PRE-FLIGHT
Team members will conduct a pre-flight assessment of the incident environment to ensure the
proposed operation is within COA guidelines and Department UAS Policy. The UAS team will
determine if safe operation of the UAS can be accomplished as requested by the IC. The decision
will be contingent upon several factors to include physical features of the area, obstructions to
flight, terrain, and the weather. The UAS PIC will make the final determination if flight operations
can be initiated. The Incident Command Team and UAS Team must coordinate before initiating
ANY UAS flight operations. When and where appropriate and applicable, team members will
ensure that all authority has been obtained.
Before launch, the designated PIC and VO must complete a thorough pre-flight
inspection. The pre-flight checklist will be utilized to perform the required checks and
risk assessment.
(The pre-flight checklist can be located in the Forms Appendix A)
NIGHT FLIGHT OPERATIONS
•
•
•

•
•
•

UAS will only be used at night if the pilot has the proper authorization/waiver in place.
UAS team members should obtain the minimum altitude necessary to avoid
obstructions in the operating area prior to nightfall if possible.
Due to field of view and distortion issues, night vision goggles may not be used as the
primary means for visual observation duties. Such devices are ONLY permitted for
augmentation of the Flight Observer’s visual capability.
Flight Observers must use caution to ensure the UA remains within normal line-of-sight.
The use of UAS Staff and the use of lighting and/or IR beacons to identify the
launch/recover areas is highly recommended.
A Visual Observer (VO) must be used at night.

DECONFLICTION OF AIRCRAFT
•
•
•
•

All UAS flights shall be grounded upon arrival of approved government manned aircraft
entering the operational air space unless coordinated flight training has occurred with
that agency.
Deconfliction shall occur by the Lead PIC of the aircraft.
It is the responsibility of the UAS pilot and Visual Observer to confirm and maintain
awareness of all manned aircraft activity during UAS operations.
In the event a non-Department UAV is identified within the operational air space, the
PIC shall notify the Incident Commander and immediately follow incursion protocols.

POST-FLIGHT
•
•
•

After landing, a thorough post-flight inspection of the UAS must be completed by the
designated PIC and VO. A post-flight checklist shall be utilized for the inspection
procedure.
Any decontamination will be performed in strict accordance with the
specifications and guidelines of the UAS manufacturer.
UAS deployment report will be submitted to Operations Chief and Shift
Commander. (The post-flight checklist can be located in the Forms Appendix
A)

MANNED AND UNMANNED JOINT OPERATIONS
To ensure safe, coordinated, and effective response of UAS resources, an accountability system
shall be implemented at all incidents where aircraft are utilized.
PFD UAS will not fly in the same airspace as other public safety or government agencies
unless inter- agency deconfliction training has occurred and both agencies have signed off as
being proficient. For example, deconfliction training with Phoenix PD “Firebird” does not clear
PFD UAS to fly in the same
airspace as DPS “Ranger”. Separate deconfliction training is required.
POLICY
•

Command will maintain resource accountability at all incidents.

•

Incident Commanders are responsible for the notification to incident aircraft,
tracking and documenting of responding unit response (to include UAS resources),
and utilizing tactical worksheets and incident action plans.
Manned aircraft take priority and have precedence over airspace.
Both manned and unmanned resources shall establish and maintain communications.
All UAS resources shall establish and maintain separation assurance standards
through the demarcation of altitude, horizontal distance, and /or geographical areas of
operation.
Dispatch will announce UAS operations during incident response. UAS operations
shall be communicated to manned aircraft at the time of the request.

Page 17 of 30

COMMUNICATIONS
During both training and emergency incident response, radio communications shall be
established and maintained between both the manned and unmanned aircraft (team? Pilot?).
Typically, all Air Operations communications (manned and unmanned) take place on the
assigned Air Ops channel. For example, an Air Operations channel is assigned to emergency
response incidents that occur within Maricopa County.
A second option is the air-to-air frequency of 123.025; however, this is currently only available
on ICOM air-to-air radios carried by the UAS response vehicle.
If no communication has been established, the UAS shall land immediately upon hearing or
seeing any public safety aircraft until positive communication is established.
SEPARATION ASSURANCE STANDARDS
Operations may occur up to a maximum altitude of 400 feet AGL or, if higher than 400 AGL,
remain within 400 feet of a structure unless otherwise approved by waiver or Certificate of
Authorization.
When working in joint airspace, safe separation of aircraft shall be maintained through altitude,
horizontal distance, and /or geographical areas of operation such as using roads, rivers, or other
natural dividing lines to deconflict the air space. The RPIC shall establish direct communication
with the manned resource and develop the necessary separation clearances.
If communication cannot be established, or separation cannot be maintained, the UAS shall
give right- of-way to the manned aircraft and return to its landing area until flight becomes safe
again.
LOST LINK / GPS PROCEDURES
Lost link is an interruption or loss of the control link between the control station and
the unmanned aircraft. This prevents control of the aircraft and results in the aircraft
performing pre-set lost link procedures. While operating in controlled airspace, in the
event of a lost link that cannot be re-established within a reasonable time, a
designated crew member shall immediately notify the appropriate authority.
When possible, lost link and lost GPS procedures shall comply with the following:
•

•

The aircraft autopilot will enter a lost link mode within 10 seconds of the lost link condition
being detected, return to the LZ or other defined lost link waypoint within the UAS
operating area, and
land.
If the aircraft loses GPS, the RPIC will immediately attempt to land the aircraft in a safe

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

M.P. 205.24

•

12/24-N

Page 18 of 30

location by controlling it manually or landing at the current location within the operating
area.
If both GPS and data link are lost, the aircraft will automatically land at the current position.

EMERGENCY FLY AWAY PROCEDURES
In the event of a fly-away or other emergency scenario while operating in controlled airspace,
the designated crew member shall immediately notify the appropriate FAA authority and Sky
Harbor Aviation Department Airport Duty Manager (602) 273-3388, and provide the following
information:
• The nature of the emergency
• Last known aircraft position, altitude, and direction of flight
• Maximum remaining flight time
LOST SIGHT
If a VO loses sight of the aircraft, the VO shall immediately notify the RPIC. The RPIC shall place
the aircraft into hover mode while the RPIC and VO try to reestablish visual contact with the
aircraft. If the aircraft is visually reacquired, the mission may continue. If visual contact is not
reacquired within a reasonable period of time, the RPIC shall initiate the Return to Home
sequence.
For operational necessity, the PIC or RPIC may intentionally maneuver the UAS so that they lose
sight of it for brief periods of time. In this case, the RPIC must regain VLOS as soon as
practicable. For
example, a RPIC stationed on the ground utilizing a UAS to inspect a rooftop may lose sight of
the aircraft for brief periods while inspecting the farthest point of the roof. As another example, a
RPIC conducting a search operation around a fire scene may briefly lose sight of the aircraft
while it is temporarily behind a dense column of smoke.
However, although the RPIC may briefly lose sight of the UAS, the RPIC always has the see-andavoid responsibilities set out in Part 107, §§ 107.31 and 107.37. The circumstances of what would
prevent a
RPIC from fulfilling those responsibilities will vary, depending on factors such as the type of
UAS, the operational environment, and distance between the RPIC and the
UAS. For this reason, there is no specific time interval that interruption of VLOS is permissible,
as it would have the effect of potentially allowing a hazardous interruption or prohibiting a
reasonable one.
(See the Contingency Plan Checklist in the Forms Appendix B)
DOCUMENTATION
Each flight will be recorded in both the UAS department’s flight log and the pilot’s

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS)
M.P. 205.24

12/24-N

Page 19 of 30

personal flight logbook. Note: the flight log and PIC flight logbook are public records.
A “UAS Deployment Report” must be submitted any time a UAS Team is deployed on a
training mission or active incident. This report will be submitted to the Operations Chief and
the Shift Commander.
MEDICAL FACTORS
The health of the flight crew is paramount and any member of the UAS program must stand
down if they feel they are not able to perform their duties.
A self-assessment of physical condition shall be made by all flight crewmembers during
pre-flight activities.
No member shall act as a PIC or a VO within eight hours (8) after consumption of any alcoholic
beverage.
COMMUNICATION LINK
The Phoenix Fire Dept. UAS fleet will use the Public Safety Broadband Network devices and
connectivity.
DATA COLLECTION AND USE
The Phoenix Fire Department will only use UAS-collected information for an official and
authorized purpose. Data will not be shared with vendors except as part of official Fire
Department purposes.
UAS flight data, whether training or incident related, will be recorded in a “flight log”
specific to each UAS owned by the department.
A UAS digital media file may be utilized as a training tool for specific units or the department as
a whole. Fire department personnel requesting utilization of a UAS digital media file for training
purposes shall submit their request to the UAS Program Manager.
In most cases, “real time” information will be captured solely to transmit “live” footage to a
Department Incident Commander or command post. Although there may be occasional
benefits to sharing, recording, and retaining visual data, this is NOT the intended purpose when
a UAS is launched in public space or in and around public property or domains.
DATA RETENTION
All pictures and videos captured during a flight will be stored in accordance with the City and
Fire Department’s Data Retention Policy.
It will be the Department’s policy and practice to record visual data of the emergent incident only

Requests for UAS digital media, including requests from Federal Prosecutors, the State Attorney
General’s Office, County Attorneys or City Prosecutor’s Office, shall be forwarded to the Phoenix
Fire Department Personnel Division, with sufficient information to locate the specific UAS file. It
may be necessary to redact personally identifiable information, or information to protect a patient
and/or civilian’s medical and/or personal privacy.
Photographic and video data that is collected will be retained in accordance with Fire
Department Policies and its Records Retention Schedule. This will be determined by the
nature of the record in question.
DATA STORAGE
PFD personnel will utilize only hardware/software storage systems approved by the City’s
Information Technology Section and in accordance with existing City policies and procedures.
All digital media captured will be stored in accordance with the standards set forth by the
TS&P subcommittee for data storage.
REQUEST FOR DELETION OF ACCIDENTAL RECORDING
In the event of an accidental activation and/or recording, the recording employee will contact
the UAS Manager and request that the UAS digital media file be deleted by PFD UAS redaction
personnel.
The UAS Manager, the Public Affairs Chief, and Legal shall review the file and affirm that
the file does not contain images that represent a breach of privacy or have evidentiary
value and make a recommendation to the Homeland Chief to approve or deny the deletion
request.
DISSEMINATION OF INFORMTION
Dissemination, outside of the PFD, of UAS-collected information shall NOT take place unless
required by law, to fulfill an authorized departmental purpose, or to comply with existing City
and/or department requirements. Notwithstanding any provisions of this policy regarding
confidentiality, or protected rights, all documents and videos related to the Departments UAS
Program may be subject to disclosure by laws related to open public records.
