CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGEMENT
M.P. 201.00

10/15-R

06/20-SR

The Central Arizona Life Safety System Response Council (CALSSRC), Automatic Aid System is a consortium of
governments (Cities, Towns, and Fire Districts) joined by an intergovernmental agreement upon which the
participants agree to operationally act as one-entity for the purpose of improved fire/rescue/emergency medical
services. Together we respond to hundreds-of-thousands of calls for service each year, some calls may seem routine
to us, but for the person who called, it is not routine. As professionals we will provide excellent customer service on
each and every call, to each and every customer.
CALSSRC defines the customer as, any person who receives our services and anyone with who our members have
dealings. Examples of this definition include:
• The actual service recipient
• Anyone who knows or is closely related to the service recipient (e.g., family, friends, neighbors, etc.)
• The people we encounter, directly and indirectly during our workday (e.g., members of organizations we
routinely do business with, people who visit our workplace, people who see us during our workday, and
people who see us on the road)
• The members of our organization including support staff (our customer services begin with how we treat
each other)
These customers are an integral part of our workday. We will treat them in a positive way and include them in our
plan to execute excellent customer service. Every interaction with our customers is an opportunity to solve their
problem and leave a positive, lasting impression.
PROCEDURE
Our mission and number one priority is to deliver the best customer service possible. Our members are responsible
for the following as it relates to customer service:
1. Treat all customers with respect, kindness, patience and consideration. We will respond quickly, skillfully,
and positively to every customer.
2. Deal with the customer’s situation as an urgent event, from the time we know about it until it is over.
3. Identify and act on opportunities for added value. Added value occurs when we go beyond our standard
quick, effective, professional, customer service to create a feeling that the customer was the most important
person we served all day. Added value only requires a little extra effort and leaves our customer with the
opinion that we care.
4. Provide exceptional customer service, whenever possible. CALSSRC delegates official authority and trusts its
members with the power to provide customer service to the level of their abilities and imagination. A
members evaluation as to whether or not they are empowered to provide exceptional customer service is
determined by:
a. Is it the right thing for the customer?
b. Is it the right thing for the department?
c. Is it legal, ethical, and nice?

Is it safe?
Is it on your organizational level?
Is it something you are willing to be accountable for?
Is it consistent with our department’s values and policies?

If the answer to these questions is yes, then don’t ask permission. You are empowered to provide exceptional
customer service.
5. Create and sustain a positive public image
a. Follow Phoenix Regional Standard Operating Procedures.
b. Be professional at all times.
c. Give the customer your undivided attention.
d. Take a moment (when appropriate) to educate the customer(s) about what we do and why we are
doing it.
In addition to the above, Company Officers and Command Officers are responsible for the following:
1. Provide a work environment in which exceptional customer service and added value are the result of a
refined system where members are empowered to operate between the lines to provide caring service with
both quality and value.
2. Basic organizational behavior must be customer oriented.
3. Invest in human resources by keeping customer service a part of an ongoing development process.
4. Take responsibility for themselves and their subordinates and expand authority in others.
5. Sustain and enhance regional commitment and consistency in the execution of professional services and
customer satisfaction.
OPERATIONAL INFORMATION
The organizational benefits of providing exceptional customer service, with added value, are numerous. Benefits
include:
• It saves lives and property
• Builds positive relationships and trust within our membership
• Builds positive relationships and trust in our community
• Secures and maintains adequate resources and benefits
• Positive job satisfaction
• Places us in the best position to compete
• It's fun to be nice and do nice things
• It eliminates bad press, liability, and extra paperwork
• It’s the right thing to do

Purpose
The Phoenix Fire Department responds to a wide range of emergency incidents. In order to
effectively manage personnel and resources and to provide for the safety and welfare of
personnel, we will always operate within the Incident Command System at the incident scene.
This procedure identifies the Standard Operating Procedures to be employed in establishing
Command components of the Incident Command System and applicable components of the
National Incident Management System (NIMS).
Command Procedures are designed to:







Fix the responsibility for Command on a certain individual through a standard
identification system, depending on the arrival sequence of members, companies, and
Command officers.
Ensure that a strong, direct, and visible Command will be established from the onset of
the incident.
Establish an effective incident organization defining the activities and responsibilities
assigned to the Incident Commander (IC) and the other individuals operating within the
Incident Command System.
Provide a system to process information to support incident management, planning,
and decision‐making.
Provide a system for the orderly transfer of Command to subsequent arriving officers.
Ensure a seamless transition from a Type 5/4 incident to a Type 3/2/1 (NIMS).

Roles and Responsibilities within the Incident Command System

Responsibilities of Command
The Incident Commander is responsible for the completion of the tactical objectives. The
Tactical Objectives are:
 Rescue
 Fire Control
 Property Conservation
See M.P. 202.02A for more detail explanation
The Incident Command System is used to facilitate the completion of the Tactical Objectives.
The Incident Commander is the person who drives the command system towards that end. The
Incident Commander is responsible for building a Command structure that matches the
organizational needs of the incident to achieve the completion of the Tactical Objectives for the
incident. The Functions of Command define standard activities that are performed by the
Incident Commander to achieve the Tactical Objectives.
Functions of Command
The Functions of Command include:
1. Assume and announce Command and establish an effective initial command position
(Command Post).
2. Rapidly evaluate the situation (size up).
3. Initiate, maintain, and control effective incident communications.
4. Provide and manage a steady, adequate, and timely stream of appropriate resources.
5. Identify the incident strategy, develop an Incident Action Plan (IAP), and assign
companies and personnel consistent with plans and standard operating procedures.
6. Develop an effective incident organization using Sectors/Divisions/Groups to
decentralize and delegate geographic and functional responsibility.
7. Review, and revise (as needed) the strategy to keep the IAP current.
8. Provide for the continuity, transfer, and termination of Command.
The Incident Commander is responsible for all of these functions. As Command is transferred,
so is the responsibility for these functions. The first six (6) functions must be addressed

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Command Procedures

immediately from the initial assumption of Command. Use of the Strategic Decision Making
Model greatly increases effectiveness of the command team.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Establishing Command
The first fire department member or unit to arrive at the scene of a multiple unit response shall
assume command of the incident*. The initial Incident Commander shall remain in Command
until Command is transferred, or the incident is stabilized and Command is terminated.


One or two company responses that are not going to escalate beyond the commitment
of these companies do not require the first arriving unit or officer to assume Command.
The first arriving unit or officer will, however remain responsible for any needed
Command functions. Examples would include:
o Single unit response
o Check Hazard
o Any EMS call requiring only one or two companies

The first arriving fire department unit initiates the command process by giving an initial radio
report.
The standard Initial Radio Report includes:
On‐Scene Report
1. Clear alarm.
2. Unit designation/on the scene.
3. Building/area description.
 Occupancy
 Size (large, medium, small)
 Height (assumed 1 story unless reported otherwise)
4. Obvious problem/conditions.
 Nothing showing (indicates checking)
 Smoke showing (amount and location)
 Fire showing (amount and location)
 Working fire
 Fully involved
5. Action taken.
 Assuming command
 Laying a line
 Attacking with…etc.
6. Declaration of Strategy.
 Offensive or defensive
7. Command confirmation with name

Examples:
For an offensive structure fire ‐
Engine 11 to Alarm ‐ “Engine 11 is on the scene of a large two‐story school with a working
fire on the second floor. Engine 11 is laying a supply line and going in with a hand‐line to the
second floor for search & rescue and fire attack. This is an offensive fire attack. Engine 11 will
be 7th Street Command."
For a defensive fire ‐
Engine 11 to Alarm ‐ "Engine 11 is on the scene of a medium size warehouse fully involved
with exposures to the east. Engine 11 is laying a supply line and attacking the fire with a stang
gun and a hand‐line to the east exposure to check for extension. This is a defensive fire. Engine
11 will be Buckeye Command.
For an E.M.S. incident ‐
Ladder 11 to Alarm ‐ "Ladder 11 is on the scene with a multi‐vehicle accident. Give me the
balance of a 2 and 1 medical with three ambulances. Ladder 11 will be Parkway Command."
Follow‐up Report
1. Any immediate safety concerns
2. Accountability started (announce the initial accountability location)
3. Disposition of resources (hold/add/return)
4. Disposition of IRIC (only required if IRIC will not be present)
Examples:
For an offensive structure fire ‐
7th Street Command to Alarm ‐ “Engine 11 will be North side accountability. Give me the
balance a 1st Alarm."
For a defensive fire ‐
Buckeye Command to Alarm – “Engine 11 will be South side accountability. Give me the
balance of a 1st Alarm”.
For an E.M.S. incident – Parkway Command to Alarm – “be advised we have a total of 3
patients, 2 Immediates and 1 delayed. All patients have been extricated”.

PHOENIX REGIONAL

Page 6 of 38

Radio Designation
The radio designation "COMMAND" will be used along with the occupancy or address of the
incident (i.e. "7th Street Command", "Metro Center Command"). This designation will not
change throughout the duration of the incident. The designation of "Command" will remain
with the officer currently in command of the incident throughout the event.
Command Options
The responsibility of the first arriving unit or member to assume Command of the incident
presents several options, depending on the situation. If a Chief Officer, member, or unit without
tactical capabilities (i.e. staff vehicle, no equipment, etc.) initiates Command; the establishment
of a Command Post should be a top priority. At most incidents, the initial Incident Commander
will be the Company Officer. The following Command options define the Company Officer’s
direct involvement in tactical activities and the modes of Command that may be utilized.
Investigative Mode (Nothing Showing):
This is a mobile IC on a portable radio, moving around and evaluating conditions while looking
for the incident problem. The company officer should go with the company to investigate while
utilizing a portable radio to command the incident.
Fast Attack:
Visible working fires in houses or commercial occupancies. IC #1 arrives and his/her direct
participation in the attack will make a positive difference in the outcome (search and rescue,
fire control, and crew safety). They give an initial radio report and quickly assign an attack team
(2 engines and ladder) coming in behind them. Next arriving units all stage. IC #1 goes inside
(when in the offensive mode) with a portable radio supervising their crew in the attack.
Examples of these situations include:






Visible working fire in a house or small commercial occupancy.
Critical life safety situations (i.e. rescue that must be achieved in a compressed time.
Any incident where the safety and welfare of fire fighters is a major concern.
Obvious working incidents that require further investigation by the Company Officer.
Combined crew experience level

In fast attack mode, the IC must initiate and continue command until a command officer arrives
and the transfer of command is completed. The entire team responding in behind the fast
attackers must realize that the IC is in an attack position inside the hazard zone attempting to

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Command Procedures

M.P. 201.01

Page 7 of 38

quickly solve the incident problem. Responding companies must critically listen to radio traffic,
update, review and reinforce the initial size up, verify the safety, welfare, and accountability of
the fast attackers, and back up the basic attack.
The Fast‐attack‐mobile Command mode should not last more than a few minutes and will end
with one of the following:
1. Situation is stabilized.
2. Command is transferred from the fast attack company officer IC to a later arriving
command officer.
3. If the situation is not stabilized, the fast attack company officer IC must move to an
exterior (stationary) command position and is now in the Command mode. The
company officer must decide whether or not to withdraw the remainder of the
crew, based on the crew’s capabilities and experience, safety issues, and the ability
to communicate with the crew. No crew will remain in a hazardous area without
radio communications.
Command Mode ‐ Stationary Command Post:
Certain incidents, by virtue of their size, complexity, or potential for rapid expansion, demand
early, strong, stationary command from the outset. In these cases, the first arriving IC will
assume command and, from the very beginning stay out of the hazard zone in a stationary
exterior command position. The IC must remain there until the incident is terminated or
command is transferred. The tactical worksheet shall be initiated and utilized to assist in
managing these types of incidents.
If the Company Officer assumes a Command mode, the following options are available with
regards to the assignment of the remaining crew members.
1. "Move up" an acting officer within the Company. This is determined by the individual
and collective capabilities and experience of the crew.
2. Assign the crew members to perform staff functions to assist the IC. Staff functions
include recon/reporting, communications assistance; help with tactical worksheet
tracking etc.
3. Assign company personnel to another Company. This creates a larger work group with
an officer. This must be acknowledged by both the original and the receiving officer and
by their inclusion in the accountability system.
Transfer of Command
Command is transferred to improve the quality of the Command organization. When Command
is transferred, it should trigger upgrades in the Command structure. The following guidelines
outline the transfer of Command. Using a standard routine for both establishing and

transferring command creates the capability within the responding units for the IC to effectively
and safely establish and continue command. Using a fast attack company officer IC (IC #1) in the
initial stages of an offensive incident, and then having a subsequent arriving response
command officer (IC #2) transfer, strengthens and continues command within the IAP from an
upgraded Command Post (CP), in a vehicle, outside the hazard zone, creates a strong, safe, and
under control approach. The benefits of an upgraded CP include:






Provides IC #2 with a Support Officer
Establishes an Incident Safety Officer (FIT) (ISO)
IC #2 has a wider view of the fireground
Improves communication
Creates a lighted, warm (or cool), and dry environment for IC #2 to operate in

Transfer of Command process
1.
The first fire department member arriving on the scene will automatically
assume Command. This will normally be a Company Officer but could be any fire
department member up to and including the Fire Chief.
2.
The first arriving Company Officer will assume Command after the Transfer of
Command procedures have been completed (assuming an equal or higher
ranking officer has not already assumed Command). IC #1 is usually a Company
Officer.
3.
The first arriving Command Officer should assume Command of the incident
following Transfer of Command procedures and becomes IC #2.
4.
Subsequent arriving Command Officers should report their location to the IC and
wait for an assignment. The first arriving Shift Commander will assume the role
of Senior Advisor and assist the IC. The Engineer of the CRV will set up the
Command Response Vehicle (CRV) while the Senior Advisor manages the
transition of the Command Team to the CRV. The Senior Advisor, IC and Support
Officer become the Command Team (Incident Advisory Team). The Command
Team may assign additional staff such as a Safety Officer (relieves the Support
Officer’s ISO responsibility) and a Staging Officer.
5.
Assumption of Command is discretionary for Assistant Chiefs and the Fire Chief.
6.
Local events that are of long duration or require long term evacuations may
require a larger Command staff including Planning Chief, Liaison, and Public
Information Officer (PIO). The Assistant Chief of Operations may provide
additional support by assisting the Senior Advisor while a Shift Commander
manages the evacuation and Command staff.
7.
When an incident is so large or of such duration that State or Federal resources
are called to assist, an Incident Management Team (IMT) may be assigned to
manage these resources. In this case the local jurisdiction having authority (JHA)
will maintain Command or delegate authority for managing resources to the
IMT. In either case the JHA retains authority to set incident objectives and
determine when the IMT, State, and Federal resources are no longer needed.
In certain situations, it may be advantageous for the first arriving IC (i.e. Company Officer) to
transfer Command to the next Company ON SCENE. This is indicated when the initial
commitment of the first arriving Company requires a full crew (i.e., high‐rise or an immediate
rescue situation) and another Company or Command Officer is on the scene. When a Chief
Officer arrives at the scene at the same time as the initial arriving Company, the Chief Officer
should assume Command of the incident.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

M.P. 201.01

Page 10 of 38

"Passing Command" to a unit that is not on the scene creates a gap in the Command process
and compromises incident management. To prevent this "gap", Command shall not be
transferred to an officer who is not on the scene.
Should a situation occur where a later arriving Company or Command officer cannot locate or
communicate with Command (after several radio attempts), they will assume and announce
their assumption of Command and initiate whatever actions are necessary to confirm the safety
of the missing crew.
Within the chain of Command, the actual transfer of Command will be regulated by the
following procedure:
1.
The officer assuming Command (IC #2) will communicate with the person being
relieved (IC #1) by radio or face‐to‐face. Face‐to‐face is the preferred method to
transfer Command.
2.
The person being relieved will brief the officer assuming Command indicating at
least the following:
A. General situation status:
1) Incident conditions (fire location and extent, Hazmat spill or release, number
of patients, etc.)
2) Incident Management Plan. Completion of the Tactical Objectives.
3) Safety considerations.
B. Deployment and assignments of operating companies and personnel.
C. Appraisals of need for additional resources.
3. When an incident becomes so large that an Incident Management Team (IMT) is
requested, Command will not transfer to the IMT (Type I/III) unless a formal written
Delegation of Authority has been signed by both the JHA and the IMT.
The arrival of a ranking Officer on the incident scene does not mean that Command has been
automatically transferred to that Officer. Command is only transferred when the Transfer of
Command process has been completed. The person being relieved of Command will be
assigned to the best advantage by the Officer assuming Command.
A ranking Officer may elect to have a subordinate continue the role of Incident Commander. In
cases where an individual is effectively commanding an incident, and satisfactory progress is
being made to bring the incident under control, it may be desirable for that person to continue
in an active Command role. The ranking Officer must determine that the Incident Commander
is completely aware of the position and function of operating companies and the general status
of the situation. In these cases, the arriving ranking Officer may assume a supportive role in the
overall Command organization.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

M.P. 201.01

Page 11 of 38

The response and arrival of additional command officers strengthens the overall Command
organization. As the incident escalates, the IC should use these Command Officers to fill Sector
(Division), Branch, and Section positions. Command should consider adding a command officer
to any sector with three or more operating companies. Strengthening the Command
organization:






Improves safety
Decreases the span of control
Improves communication
Improves accountability
Improves management and supervision of the Sector

When the first arriving unit is a Command Officer, efforts should be automatically directed
towards establishing a Command Post and fulfilling the Command functions. A Command Post
in a vehicle equipped for this purpose is a priority at all working incidents. A vehicle that
provides appropriate work space for the Incident Commander and staff personnel, lighting,
communications equipment, supplies reference items, and some isolation from outside
distractions will make Command more effective.
Company and Command Officers should eliminate all unnecessary radio traffic while
responding, unless such communications are required to ensure that Command functions are
initiated and completed. This requires the initial Incident Commander to give a clear initial radio
report and continue to give updated progress reports as needed.
Command Officers should stage over the radio. Staff Personnel should report directly to the
Command Post to notify the Incident Commander of their availability to assume incident duties.
These personnel should park their vehicles in a location that does not restrict access to the
scene.
The IC is responsible for managing the incident. The fire department empowers the IC with the
authority to turn his/her decisions into actions (develop an IAP and assign companies). Simply
stated, the Incident Commander outranks everybody*. If a higher‐ranking Officer wants to
affect a change in the management of an incident, he/she must first be on the scene of the
incident, and then follow the Transfer of Command procedure.
Anyone can effect a change in incident management in extreme situations relating to safety by
notifying Command and initiating corrective action.
The Incident Command System (ICS) never "sleeps". The ICS is in a constant state of readiness.
When there are no working incidents the Alarm Headquarters and its Supervisor have the

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Command Procedures

M.P. 201.01

01/18

Page 12 of 38

responsibility of initiating the ICS. When the Alarm Room receives notification of a working
incident (normally via the telephone) they start the ICS process by giving instruction to the
caller and dispatching the appropriate response. The Alarm Room continues in an active
management role by ensuring that the first on‐scene unit takes Command. The Shift
Commander has this responsibility by being the highest ranking on duty member.
Command Team (Incident Advisory Team)
Note: The roles and responsibilities of the Command Team are identical to the roles and
responsibilities of the Incident Advisory Team. The Command Team consists of the Incident
Commander (IC), Support Officer, and Senior Advisor. On the Incident Advisory Team these
roles are filled by the Incident Commander (IC), Support Advisor, and Incident Advisor
respectively. Our system uses Command Team terminology but as previously stated the roles
and responsibilities for each position remains the same.
A Command Team is an organizational response to quickly provide enough command and
control to rapidly bring a significant incident under control. The primary players in the
Command Team are the IC, Support Officer, and Senior Advisor.
The incident scene is often dynamic and intense. As the incident grows into and past the
requirements of a first alarm assignment, the IC can become overwhelmed with information
management, assigning Companies, filling out and updating the tactical worksheet, planning,
forecasting, calling for additional resources, talking on the radio, and fulfilling all the other
functions of Command. The immediate need of Command at this point is support. In some
organizations, the ICs driver (FIT, ISO, BSO etc.) fulfills the role of Support Officer, in
organizations without this advantage the IC may choose to utilize the next arriving Command
Officer as a Support Officer. The IC may decide to assign the second Command Officer to a
Sector (Division) if he/she feels the presence of a Command Officer in a particular Sector will
improve safety and communications in that Sector by reducing the span of control.
Establishing an Incident Command Team
The first in command officer, usually a BC with a FIT, or ISO, assumes command (IC #2) from the
initial IC (IC #1, usually a company officer). Once IC #2 assumes Command the FIT becomes
his/her Support Officer and the designated Incident Safety Officer (ISO) (Note: Some members
of the consortium may slightly differ in assigning responsibilities to the FIT/ISO/BSO per their
department's SOPs). If the initial assignment stabilizes the situation, this is as far as command
needs to grow. If the situation is not stabilized and continues to grow, so does the command
organization. The next in command officer (usually a BC) stages on the radio. IC #2 normally
assigns this BC to a Sector but if IC #2 does not have a FIT the second BC may be assigned as IC
#2’s support officer (and ISO) as described earlier in this M.P.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Page 13 of 38

The IC and the Support Officer are the first and second members of the Command Team.
It is the Responsibility of the IC to perform the Functions of Command to achieve the Tactical
Objectives.
1. Assume and announce Command and establish an effective initial command position
(Command Post).
2. Rapidly evaluate the situation (size up).
3. Initiate, maintain, and control effective incident communications.
4. Provide and manage a steady, adequate, and timely stream of appropriate resources.
5. Identify the incident strategy, develop an Incident Action Plan (IAP), and assign
companies and personnel consistent with plans and standard operating procedures.
6. Develop an effective incident organization using Sectors/Divisions/Groups to
decentralize and delegate geographic and functional responsibility.
7. Review, and revise (as needed) the strategy to keep the IAP current.
8. Provide for the continuity, transfer, and termination of Command.
Roles and Responsibilities of the Support Officer:





Evaluate the need for additional resources.
Assign logistics responsibilities.
Assist with the tactical worksheet for control and accountability.
Evaluate the fireground organization and span of control.
Other duties as necessary.

The third member of the Command Team is the Senior Advisor. The Senior Advisor is normally
the highest‐ranking member of the Command Team. The first arriving Shift Commander usually
fills the role of the Senior Advisor. The Officer serving as "Command" and the Support Officer
will focus on the completion of the tactical objectives, the strategic and tactical plan and the
other components of the incident. The Senior Advisor's focus is looking at the entire incident
and its impact from a broader perspective and providing direction, guidance and advice to the
IC and/or Support Officer.

Provide on‐going review of the overall incident (THE BIG PICTURE).
Review the organizational structure, initiate change or expansion to meet incident
needs.
Initiate Section and Branch functions as required.
Provide a liaison with other city agencies and officials, outside agencies, property
owners and/or tenants.
Forecast and react to the effect this incident will have on surrounding neighborhoods,
Public Officials, and city staffing.
Prepare to transition to long‐term operations by establishing operational periods and
advising the Assistant Chief of Operations as to the need for an All Hazards Incident
Management Team (AHIMT), state or federal assistance.
Provide a transitional briefing to the incoming IMT if one has been assigned to the
incident.

To maintain continuity and overall effectiveness, the Senior Advisor and Support Officer must
be in the Command Post with the IC. The result is there are three people performing the
functions of Command. They are working as a team to enhance the Command process and
make the functions of Command more effective. The Officer assigned to communicate directly
to Companies, Sectors (Divisions or Groups), or Branches will use the radio designation
"Command” and should be the only member of the Command Team talking on the tactical
radio channel.
Command Structure
It is the responsibility of Command to develop an organizational structure, using standard
operating procedures, to effectively manage the incident scene. The development of the
organizational structure should begin with deployment of the first arriving fire department unit
and continue through a number of phases, depending on the size and complexity of the
incident. The Command organization must develop at a pace which stays ahead of the tactical
deployment of personnel and resources. In order for the Incident Commander to manage the
incident, he/she must first be able to direct, control, and track the position and function of all
operating Companies. Building a Command organization is the best support mechanism the

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Command Procedures

M.P. 201.01

01/18

Page 15 of 38

Incident Commander can utilize to achieve a balance between managing personnel and incident
needs. Simply put, this means:
Large scale and complex incidents = Big Command organization.
Small scale and "simple" incidents = Little Command organization.



The Incident Commander should have more people working than commanding.
The basic configuration of Command includes three levels:
o Strategic Level ‐ Overall direction of the incident.
o Tactical Level ‐ Objectives assigned to Sectors (Divisions or Groups)
o Task Level ‐ Task objectives assigned to Companies.

Strategic – This organizational level is designed around the IC and Command Team, operating in
the Command Mode, and working out of a stationary command post. The strategic level
involves the activities necessary for overall operational control and the completion of the
tactical objectives, regardless of the size or complexity of the incident. This is completed most
effectively through the strategic decision making model. This includes:









Provide initial and ongoing size‐up and the determination of the critical fireground
factors.
Based on the size‐up, define the incident position within the risk management plan
Determining the appropriate strategy: OFFENSIVE OR DEFENSIVE
Establishing a strategic level incident action plan for the incident.
Obtaining and allocating resources.
Deployment of the appropriate resources.
Predicting outcomes and planning.
Assigning specific assignments and objectives to tactical level units.

Tactical ‐ The first management “subdivision” of incident scene organization is accomplished by
assigning Sector (Division or Group) responsibilities. Sector officers are responsible for the
tactical deployment of assigned resources, evaluation, and communication with the IC. They are
assigned by the IC and supervise directly at the site of the assigned activity in order to meet the
operational objectives given to them by the IC.
Task – The level of the organization where the work is performed by assigned companies and
other resources. The Strategic and Tactical levels are in place to support the task level. Task
level activities are routinely supervised by Company Officers. The accumulated achievements of
Task Level activities accomplish Tactical Objectives.

Command Structure ‐ Basic Organization
Incident organization is the function of command that the IC uses to track, communicate with,
and account for resources in order to meet the tactical objectives. For fires this is RESCUE – FIRE
CONTROL – PROPERTY CONSERVATION – CUSTOMER STABILIZATION.
Examples:
The most basic Command structure combines all three levels of the Command structure. The
Company Officer on a single engine response to a dumpster fire determines the strategy and
tactics, and supervises the crew doing the task.

Task

The basic structure for a "routine" incident, involving a small number of Companies, requires
only two levels of the Command structure. The role of Command combines the strategic and
tactical levels. Companies report directly to Command and operate at the Task Level.

Command Structure ‐ Sectors Basic Operational Approach
A Sector is a smaller, more manageable unit of incident scene organization. Sectoring is a
standard system of dividing incident scene command into smaller units or pieces. Whenever
there are three or more companies operating in a sector, the IC should assign a Battalion Chief
and FIT to that sector. The maximum number of Sectors that an IC can effectively manage is
called the span of control. The span of control is usually five sectors and should never exceed
seven sectors.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Command Procedures

M.P. 201.01

01/18

Page 17 of 38

Sectors
NOTE: Sectors may be assigned by their geographic location (North Sector) or function
(Ventilation Sector). Divisions are assigned by their geographic location (North Division). Groups
are assigned by their function (Ventilation Group). For the remainder of this M.P. we will refer
to Sectors with the understanding that either Divisions or Groups may be used where
appropriate.
A significant problem occurs when the IC requests and assigns additional companies, at a rate
that exceeds the development of the incident organization. In short order, the IC will become
overloaded with the details of managing a large number of companies scattered all over the
incident site. The IC will soon be in the odd situation of being overwhelmed, yet still in need of
more resources to accomplish their tactical objectives.
Command must develop and build an organization that matches the deployment of resources
to the incident scene. The IC accomplishes this by breaking the incident scene down into
manageable subunits called sectors. Sectors are geographic or functional and are managed by
Sector Officers.
As Sectors are implemented, Command continues to operate at the strategic level, determining
the overall strategy and Incident Action Plan to deal with the incident.

When the number of Sectors exceeds the span of control that the Incident Commander can
effectively manage, the Incident Organization should be divided to Branches. Each Branch is
responsible for several Sectors and should be assigned a separate radio channel. Branches will
be addressed later in this M.P.
Once effective sectors have been established, the IC can concentrate on the overall strategy,
incident action plan management, evaluation, and resource allocation. Each of the sector
officers becomes responsible for the tactical deployment of the resources assigned to his/her
sector and communicating needs and progress back to Command.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Command Procedures

M.P. 201.01

01/18

Page 18 of 38

Utilizing Sectors provides the following advantages:







Reduces the IC’s span of control – divides the incident scene into more manageable
units.
Creates more effective incident scene communications – permits the IC to exchange
information with a limited number of individuals (Sector Officers) who directly supervise
teams of firefighters. This reduces overall radio traffic by allowing firefighters and sector
officers to communicate face to face instead of by radio.
Provides a standard and logical system to divide large geographical incidents into
effectively sized units – allows the IC to concentrate on strategy from one standard
command post location.
Provides an array major support functions – these are to be selected and assigned
according to the particular needs of each situation. The execution and details of these
specific operations becomes the responsibility of the sector officer, not command.
Improves firefighter safety – allows each sector officer to maintain more direct control
of the position and function of the companies assigned to their sectors at all times.
Sector officers concentrate on their assigned areas and are in a position to move
personnel based on incident conditions and the IC’s decisions.

Command Should Assign Sectors Based on the Following Factors:
1. When the number of assigned and operating companies threatens to overload the IC’s
ability to command. Direct tactical‐level control should be delegated (earlier than later)
to sector officers before the IC’s ability to manage is exceeded.
2. When the IC forecasts that the situation will become a major operation, soon exceeding
his/her span of control.
3. When companies are involved in complex operations (Large interior or geographic area,
hazardous materials, technical rescues, etc.)
4. When companies are operating from tactical positions which Command has little or no
direct control over (i.e. out of sight).
5. When the situation presents specials hazards and close control is required over
operating companies (i.e., unstable structural conditions, hazardous materials, heavy
fire load, marginal offensive situations, etc.).
6. Name the sector according to its function or geographical location.
When establishing a Sector, the IC will assign each Sector Officer:
1. Tactical Objectives.
2. A radio designation (Roof Sector, East Sector, etc.)
3. The identity of resources assigned to the Sector.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Command Procedures

M.P. 201.01

Sectors Will Be Regulated by The Following Guidelines:






It will be the ongoing responsibility of Command to assign Sectors as required for
effective emergency operations; this assignment will relate to both geographic and
functional Sectors.
Command shall advise each Sector Officer of specific Tactical Objectives. The overall
strategy and plan will and should be also provided (time permitting), so the Sector
Officer has some idea of what's going on and how his assignment fits in.
The number of Companies assigned to a Sector will depend upon conditions within that
Sector. Command will maintain an awareness of the number of Companies operating
within a Sector and the capability of that Sector Officer to effectively direct operations.
If a Sector Officer cannot control the resources within the Sector, he/she should notify
the Incident Commander so that Sector responsibilities can be split or other corrective
action taken. During offensive fires five (5) companies represents a reasonable
maximum span of control for a Sector Officer. During defensive fires seven (7)
companies represents a reasonable maximum span of control.
Sectors assigned to specific operating areas will be designated by directions (East
Sector, North Sector, etc.). Where the incident has odd geographic boundaries (Grand
Avenue) it may be confusing to assign directional designations to Sectors (East Sector,
etc.). An alternate use of Sector A, B, C, or D, pronounced: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and
Delta respectively, may be used (see page 20). Sector "A" would be the front (street
address side) of the building and the other Sectors would go clockwise around the
building in alphabetical order.

In multi‐story occupancies, Sectors will usually be indicated by floor numbers (Sector 15
indicates 15th floor). In some cases, the floor Sector identification may be subdivided into
geographic areas such as "Sector 15 East" or "Sector 15 West" depending on stairwell and floor
access. Functional Sectors will be identified by the function (Loss Control Sector, Safety Sector,
Ventilation Sector, etc.).
Sector Officers will use the Sector designation in radio communications (i.e. "North Sector to
Command").
In many cases, the initial Sector responsibility will be given to the Company Officer who
receives the initial assignment to a basic tactical position or function (north, treatment, roof,
etc.)
As the incident expands, Command Officers will be assigned Sector responsibilities.
Command will assign a Command Officer to assume Sector responsibilities as soon as possible.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Command Procedures

M.P. 201.01

01/18

Page 20 of 38

Regular Transfer of Command procedures will be followed in transferring Sector responsibility.
In some cases, a Sector Officer may be assigned to an area/function initially to evaluate and
report conditions and advise Command of needed tasks and resources. The assigned Officer will
proceed to the Sector, evaluate and report conditions to the Incident Commander, and assume
responsibility for directing resources and operations within his/her assigned area of
responsibility.
The Sector Officer must be in a position to directly supervise and monitor operations. This will
require the Sector Officer to be equipped with the appropriate protective clothing and
equipment for his/her area of responsibility. Sector Officers assigned to operate within the
hazard zone must be accompanied by a partner (normally a F.I.T.). The Sector Officer should be
readily identifiable and maintain a visible position as much as possible.
Sector Officers will be responsible for the following basic functions:










Directly supervise work in the sector.
Monitor personnel safety, accountability, and welfare.
Develop a sector IAP that integrates with the overall IAP.
Monitor work progress.
Redirect activities as necessary.
Coordinate actions with related activities, and adjacent Sectors.
Monitor welfare of Sector personnel.
Request additional resources as needed (on‐deck crews etc.).
Manage Maydays within the Sector.
Advise the IC of situation status, changing conditions, progress, completion, and
exception reports.
Re‐allocate resources within the Sector
Provide information for both formal and informal After‐Action Reviews (critiques).
De‐commit companies as operations are completed.

When a command officer is assigned Sector responsibilities the FIT/ISO becomes the Sector
Safety Officer.

The primary function of a Company Officer working within a Sector is to direct the operations of
their individual crews in performing assigned tasks. Company Officers will advise their Sector
Officer of work progress, preferably face‐to‐face. All requests for additional resources or
assistance within a Sector must be directed to the Sector Officer. Sector Officers will
communicate with "Command".
Each Sector Officer will keep Command informed of conditions and progress in the Sector
through regular progress reports. The Sector Officer must prioritize progress reports to
essential information only.
Command must be advised immediately of significant changes, particularly those involving the
ability or inability to complete an objective, hazardous conditions, accidents, structural
collapse, etc.
When a Company is assigned from Staging to an Operating Sector, the Company will be told
what Sector and which Sector Officer they will be reporting to. The Sector Officer will be
informed of which particular companies or units have been assigned by the Incident
Commander.
It is then the responsibility of the Sector Officer to contact the assigned Company to transmit
any instructions relative to the specific action requested.
Sector Officers will monitor the condition of the crews operating in their Sector. Relief crews
will be requested in a manner to safeguard the safety of personnel and maintain progress
toward the Sector objectives.
Sector Officers will insure an orderly and thorough reassignment of crews to Rehab Sector.
Crews must report to rehab intact to facilitate accountability.

Command Structure ‐ Expanding the Organization; Branch Officers
The Branch level of the organization is designed to provide COORDINATION between the
Sectors and Command. Adding Branches to the incident organization decreases the
communication load on the IC. Branch officers supervise and manage a number of Sector
Officers, and report to the Incident Commander.
As the incident organization grows in complexity, and the span of control with Sectors is
maximized, the Command Team (described on pages 12‐14), may determine that an additional
intermediate level within the Command Organization is needed. The Command Team will be
working in a stationary command post (the Command Response Vehicle) and the Senior Advisor
has the responsibility to decide whether or not to expand the organization to include branches.





Strategic Level ‐ Incident Commander
Coordination Level ‐ Branch Officers
Tactical Level ‐ Sector Officers
Task Level ‐ Companies

Branch Officers should be utilized at incidents where the span of control with Sectors is
maximized or incidents involving two or more distinctly different major management
components (i.e. a large fire with a major evacuation, a large fire with a large number of
patients). The Incident Commander may elect to assign Branch Officers as forward positions to
coordinate the activities between Sectors.

The intent of the Branch Level of the Command structure is to split an incident into manageable
components and reduce the span of control. Branch Officers will normally be utilized at very
large‐scale incidents that involve two or more major components. The following types of
incidents are examples where Branch Officers should be utilized:






A Haz mat incident that requires a major evacuation.
A large‐scale incident spread over a wide geographic area.
An incident with mass casualties and a significant hazard (for example: fire, Haz mat,
plane crash, floods, etc.)
Campaign high‐rise fires
Any incident where the number of Sectors exceed the span of control that can be
effectively managed by the incident commander.

Branch Officers manage and direct activities of Sector Officers. Branch Officers operate on the
Tactical Channel when sending or receiving information from Command. The radio designation
of Branch Officers should reflect the function or geographic area of the Branch (for example:
Fire Control Branch, Medical Branch, West Branch, etc.).
When Command Implements Branch Officers the IC will assign a separate radio channel (not
the tactical channel) for communications within the Branch. Sector Officers should be notified
by Command of their new supervisor. This information should include:



What Branch the Sector is now assigned to?
The radio channel the branch (and Sector) is operating on.

Radio Communications will then be directed from the Sector Officer to the Branch Officer.
Sector officers will still use the radio designation of Command when contacting their Branch
Officer. Sector Officers will relay Branch and radio channel information to the Companies
working in their Sector.
Note: When providing radio information to the companies in their sector, Sector officers should
obtain a PAR and insure that all members working in the sector are operating on the assigned
radio channel.
Communications between the IC and Fire Branch are on the Tactical radio channel and radio
designations are: “Command to Fire Branch” and “Fire Branch to Command”.
Communications between Fire Branch and West Sector are on channel A and radio designations
are: “Command to West Sector” and “West Sector to Command”

Command Structure ‐ Expansion to Major Operations
Sections
As a small incident escalates into a major incident, additional organizational support will be
required. As additional ranking Officers arrive on the scene, the Command Post organization
(Team) may be expanded through the involvement of Command Officers and staff personnel to
fill section positions. Section Officers assist the Incident Command Staff with the long‐term
management of the incident and operate at the Strategic Level. The Incident Commander
Implements Sections as needed, depending on the situation, and priority of needs (One
incident may only require a Logistics Section while another incident may require all the sections
to be implemented.)
Where the communications system permits, Section Officers should operate on separate radio
channels and utilize the radio designation that identifies their section (Planning, Logistics, etc.).
During the initial phases of the incident the initial Incident Commander and his/her staff
normally carry out these four section functions. The Fire Department's involvement and needs
at the incident scene can be divided into four sections. They are:
LOGISTICS SECTION
PLANNING SECTION
OPERATIONS SECTION
ADMINISTRATIVE SECTION

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

M.P. 201.01

Page 31 of 38

The Logistics Section is the support mechanism for the organization. Logistics provides services
and support systems to all the organizational components involved in the incident. Command
may assign the Logistics Section its own radio channel. The Logistic Section Officer may
establish Sectors or branches for his/her section as needed.

The Planning Section is responsible for gathering, assimilating, analyzing, and processing
information needed for effective decision‐making. Information management is a full‐time task
at large and complex incidents. The Planning Section serves as the Incident Commander's
"clearing house" for information. This allows the Incident Commander to have a single person
provide him/her with information instead of having to deal with dozens of information sources.
Critical information should be immediately forwarded to Command (or whoever needs it).
Information should also be used to make long‐range plans. The Planning Section Chief's goal is
to plan ahead of current events and to identify the need for resources before they are needed.

The Operations Section is responsible for the tactical priorities, accountability, safety and
welfare of the personnel working in the Operations Section. The Operations Section Officer
uses the tactical radio channel to communicate strategic and specific objectives to Sector
Officers and/or Branch Officers.
Roles and Responsibilities:


Manage Operation Section activities.
Personnel Accountability.
Provide for life safety.
Determine needs and request additional resources.
Consult with and inform other sections and the Incident Command Staff as needed.
Collect and provide information for an After‐Action Review.

If the Operations Officer is located at the Command Post, he/she should use the radio
designation of "Command". The vast majority of incidents can be effectively managed without
an Operations Officer, or with the Operations Officer located at the Command Post. If the
Operations Officer is located out of the Command Post at a "forward" position (i.e. in a high‐
rise building), he/she should use the radio designation of "Operations".
Implementing an "Operations" radio designation in the middle of a major incident can create
confusion with radio communications. It is absolutely essential that all personnel operating at
the incident be made aware of the activation of "Operations". All Sector Officers and/or Branch
Officers must then direct their communications to the "Operations" Officer.
The Operations Officer will communicate with the Incident Commander to request additional
resources, provide progress reports, etc.
Once implemented, "Operations" becomes a forward Command Post. As such the Operations
Officer will need some personnel assigned to assist as staff members to help with radios,
tactical worksheets, etc.

Once the Operations Officer is in place and functioning, the Incident Commander's focus should
be on the strategic issues, overall strategic planning and other components of the incident. This
focus is to look at the "big picture" and the impact of the incident from a broad perspective.
The Incident Commander should provide direction, advice and guidance to the Operations
Officer in directing the tactical aspects of the incident.

M.P. 201.01A

05/21-R

Page 1 of 4

The purpose of this procedure is to establish a standard deployment approach to communicating
company arrival to assigned work areas, to define On-Deck deployment and Company Recycling.
IN-TRANSIT
In Transit is the time it takes for a company to reach their assignment area after receiving an order.
It often varies due to:
• Distance between staging and the incident
• Size of the incident perimeter
• Amount of equipment the company needs to assemble
The Incident Commander (IC) or Sector Officer will lose direct accountability of these companies
while they’re In Transit. It is the responsibility of the Company Officer to monitor the tactical radio
channel while In Transit. Upon arrival to the assignment area the Company Officer must provide
a radio announcement to the IC (i.e., E-1 On Deck in North Sector) or report face-to-face with the
Sector Officer that the company is intact and in the assigned area.
ON-DECK
On-Deck is defined as a tactical function within a Sector for layering of resources in forward
positions. On-Deck is not an independent forward staging location. On-Deck companies should
be located just outside the immediate hazard zone, safely distanced from the entrance of a tactical
position/Sector. On-Deck crews will be supervised either by the Sector Officer or Company Officer
of the On-Deck crew and will remain On-Deck until assigned by the IC or Sector Officer. The most
likely assignments for On-Deck companies are:
• Rapid Intervention Crew
• Reinforce a position within an assigned sector
• Crew relief within an assigned sector
• Any other tactical position assigned by the IC
The IC should coordinate with the Sector Officers to provide effective resource levels in each
Sector to manage the tactical objectives, work/rest cycles, as well as reserve or layered resources
to respond to changes in conditions or a Mayday.
Once the IC has deployed units to the critical sectors around the incident scene, the IC must then
take a proactive aggressive approach to assigning additional resources to those sectors. This is
best achieved by assigning staged resources as On-Deck crews to those areas as soon as they
arrive in staged positions. Layering On-Deck crews around the fireground will also provide the IC
with the tactical reserves to manage the standard work cycle or sudden and unexpected events.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

IN-TRANSIT, ON-DECK, COMPANY RECYCLE
M.P. 201.01A

05/21-R

Page 2 of 4

Assigning On-Deck crews is done simply by contacting a staged company and directing them to
go On-Deck in a specific Sector. The order would sound like this: “Command to Engine 5, go OnDeck on the north side of the structure, Engine 1 is your accountability location, you are assigned
to North Sector.”
A crew assigned to an On-Deck position will need to park their apparatus in a manner that doesn’t
block access to the scene. Crews must be intact with full PPE, forecast the need for and collect all
the necessary tools/equipment (including the RIC Bag) and report directly to their assigned
location. Upon arrival, the On-Deck company must contact the IC or their Sector Officer and inform
them that they are in position and ready to go to work. On-Deck crews must remain intact, in a
ready state and monitor the tactical channel at all times. On-Deck crews must also size up the area
that they are assigned to, this size up should include:
• Locating the structures entrance/exit points in their assigned area
• Interior and exterior conditions
• Unit ID of crews operating inside the structure
• Approximate location of interior crews
• Identify which crews are operating each hose line
When an On-Deck crew is used as a relief crew, the Company Officer should do a face-to-face and
transfer information with the Company Officer exiting the structure. The information transferred
should include:
• Interior conditions
• Routing instructions to the work area
• Interior obstructions
• Additional tools/resources required
• Sector objectives
COMPANY RECYCLING
Recycling is defined as a timely and efficient means of air replacement and re-hydration of
companies while maintaining their sector assignment. Recycling of Companies does not
necessitate communication with the IC. The Sector Officer is responsible for the position and
function of assigned companies, including companies that are recycling. Companies operating
within a sector will require the refilling of air and fluid replacement in predictable time frames. If
conditions permit, a company work cycle could be up to 2 to 3 air cylinders. To maintain a steady
stream of resources in critical sectors, crews being relieved and exiting their sector should recycle
themselves in a timely manner. Companies being relieved and recycled will remain in their
assigned sector, follow established exposure reduction and decontamination guidelines, refill

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

IN-TRANSIT, ON-DECK, COMPANY RECYCLE
M.P. 201.01A

05/21-R

Page 3 of 4

their air supply, and re-hydrate then report back to their Sector Officer or the IC that they are ready
to go back to work.
Command/Sector Officers have the option of assigning/requesting a Utility Company to
geographic sectors. Utility companies assigned to geographic areas on the fireground will help
expedite the recycle of companies within the sector. Company Officers should forecast the length
of time they will be working in an assigned sector and should bring spare air cylinders if necessary.
This will enable a company to recycle close to their sector in a timely manner when a utility truck
is not available in their sector or area. The Sector Officer may need to request additional resources
to replace On-Deck crews or have recycled crews assume vacated On-Deck positions.
Sector and Company Officers are responsible to monitor the welfare of their personnel at all times
and determine if sector recycling or a formal rehab is appropriate. At large scale incidents
Command may establish Rehab Sector. Most of the time, crews that are assigned to rehab will be
placed back in service after rehabbing. Rehab Sector may be located quite a distance from the
work area and this distance creates the potential for:
• Command losing direct accountability of companies in transit to rehab
• Difficulty reassembling and reassigning crews in a timely manner from rehab
DIRECTION FOR ON-DECK COMPANIES
The Regional Operations Consistency Committee is charged with ensuring all Automatic Aid
Partners act as one-entity for the purposes of emergency service delivery. When assigning OnDeck Companies, the IC may provide specific direction to those companies as needed. For
example, the IC may:
• Direct the On-Deck Company to spot on a hydrant or lay a second supply line.
• Direct the On-Deck company to focus their efforts specifically on operating as a Rapid
Intervention Crew for the assigned Sector. For example, “Command to Engine 273, go OnDeck for Rescue on the south side of the structure, Engine 207 is your accountability
location, you are assigned to Interior Sector.”
In the instance of any critical need, like treatment of a civilian victim rescued from the fire, the OnDeck company should be directed to initiate treatment. If this occurs, the IC will assign another
fire company to go On-Deck for Rescue reporting to Interior Sector.
Note: Regional consistency is critical, especially in a Mayday situation. The best practice for
regional consistency in a Mayday situation is for the IC to organize the incident in a consistent

manner and for the Sector Officer to manage the resolution of the Mayday situation within their
sector.

Mayday Readiness and Response
M.P. 201.01B

01/14‐N

Page 1 of 8

Definition of a Mayday Situation
Any situation where a firefighter is unable to safely exit the hazard zone or an event that cannot be resolved by
that individual within 30 seconds
Any member working on duty is empowered to call a Mayday when the above conditions exist. This can be during
response; onscene of any incident or any time when a member becomes in trouble and a portable radio is
available. Early identification of a Mayday situation is critical. The longer it takes to declare a Mayday situation
the less likely a successful resolution is possible.
A Mayday is initiated by any member communicating “Mayday, Mayday, Mayday” via portable radio. Ideally
Tactical Radio Operators in the dispatch center will hear this transmission and initiate a response.
The Rule of Mayday Readiness
It is every individual firefighter’s responsibility to maintain a high level of Mayday readiness at all times. This
includes everyday preparation and prevention as well as the practiced ability to communicate and respond to a
Mayday scenario.
“Mayday” procedures and actions are perishable for all levels of an incident organization. The strategic, tactical
and task levels of hazard zone management should consistently and regularly be exercised for “Mayday”
procedures and practices. This also includes the Dispatch/Tactical Radio component. The preparation should be
developed into everyday activities and practiced at the company level.
Definition of Mayday Readiness
In order to reach a position of Mayday readiness, a firefighter must adopt an attitude and preparation to look at
every incident from the standpoint of “what if I or another firefighter gets in trouble” prior to the development of a
bad scenario or outcome. Additionally, the NFPA 1500 Standard defines mayday readiness as the ability to “don,
doff and manipulate the SCBA in zero visibility while wearing firefighting gloves.”
Effectively preventing Mayday situations involve multiple factors. Command Officers, Company Officers and
Firefighters must reinforce the prevention of scenarios that lead to a Mayday. The most important factors for
Mayday prevention begin with the following operational standards:





Working within an Incident Command System/Risk Management System
Working within the Incident Action Plan
Always being accountable to someone within the incident command system (Never Freelance)
Maintaining individual and crew air management

In order to establish effective Mayday readiness, it is necessary to recognize that Mayday readiness has 2
components. These components are Prevention and Response.
Task Level Mayday Readiness and Response
Every firefighter has the responsibility to actively and routinely prepare for the prevention of Mayday situations
and the response to Mayday situations.
Individual firefighter responsibilities for Mayday prevention include the following:







Maintaining SCBA proficiency
Practicing individual air management (task level of M.P. 202.05C)
Use and care personal protective equipment
Portable radio proficiency and use
Practiced crew communications
Roving/replacement firefighter integration into crew
o Individual firefighters have to be responsible to ask if not initiated by Company Officer

The Company Officer is responsible for Crew development and practice. Consistent training and practice with
regards to Mayday prevention is critical for rapid and appropriate response in a true Mayday situation. This
involves setting a consistent attitude and expectations for all crew members regarding Mayday readiness. This
also involves developing routines that are encouraged and participated in by the Company Officer.
Company Officer responsibility for Mayday preventions include:








Integrating a daily SCBA check into the crew routine
Practicing crew communication in the hazard zone
Rover integration into crew
o Individual rovers are responsible to ask if not explicitly discussed at the beginning of a shift
Maintaining knowledge of portable radios and practicing their use
Ensuring Company Officer responsibilities and expectations are clear to the entire crew
Practicing and maintaining crew integrity/accountability
Instilling the standard that firefighters should always stay on a hoseline

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Mayday Readiness and Response
M.P. 201.01B

01/14‐N

Page 3 of 8

The individual firefighter’s response to a Mayday situation should be focused on increasing the chances of
survival. The development of these skills truly begins at the Recruit level and should continue throughout a
firefighter’s career on a daily basis. The response to an individual firefighter’s Mayday should initially be managed
at the company level and as the Mayday communication happens this will initiate the defined help order.
Individual firefighter responsibilities for Mayday response include:






Maintaining preparation and reaction skills
Early communication of Mayday situation utilizing the above standard
Controlling an emotional response to the situation
Once the Mayday situation is recognized and reported, each firefighter should remember:
o B.O.A. = Breath, Organize and Act
Utilization of IAFF Fire Ground Survival training
o SCBA familiarization
o High/low profile wall breech
o Disentanglement
o Ladder bail
o Window hang
o GRAB LIVES
 G = Check Air Gauge
 R = Radio for Assistance
 A = Activate PASS Device
 B = Control Breathing, Conserve Air
 L = Stay Low
 I = Illuminate, Turn Flashlight On
 V = Make Loud Noises (Volume)
 E = Find An Exit
 S = Shield Your Airway (last ditch effort)

Tactical Level Mayday Readiness and Response
The tactical level of every incident has the responsibility to actively and routinely work toward Mayday prevention
and preparedness. The Battalion Chief and F.I.T. or I.S.O. tandem best manages these responsibilities. These
responsibilities include:




Working within the overall incident action plan
Continual assessment of the decision making model within the sector operations
Management of tactical objectives for the sector through position and functions of crews working within
this sector

o Maintain adequate resources assigned to the sector (remember to TAG hose lines)
o Layered resources in position to manage tactical objectives and prepared to respond in the event
of Mayday
Maintaining effective and appropriate communications with Command
o Sector C.A.N. reports
o Requesting or de‐committing resources

In the event of a Mayday situation, the Sector Officer will take responsibility of the resolution of the Mayday
situation. It will be necessary for the Incident Commander to support the Mayday Sector Officer with appropriate
and adequate resources to manage the Mayday at the same time reinforcing the surrounding geographical and/or
functional sectors to continue the incident mitigation. Pessimistically projecting resource requirements for sector
operations has the potential to increase the survivability of a Mayday situation. Other responsibilities include:

o There is no greater time for a clear and concise utilization of the Risk Management System than
during a Mayday event
o It is not acceptable to create further Mayday situations when resolving an existing Mayday
o These conditions must be communicated to the Incident Commander especially as conditions
deteriorate and have an immediate impact upon the rescue efforts

Strategic Level Mayday Readiness and Response
The Incident Command Team has the ultimate responsibility for actively and continually providing for the
prevention and response to a Mayday situation. The incident command team consists of the Incident
Commander, Support Officer and the Senior Advisor. There are other positions and personnel that will provide
support when working within a Command Van including the staging radio channel, logistics and safety.
The responsibilities for the Strategic Level of an incident for the prevention and response to a Mayday include:


Continually reassess the incident through the strategic decision making model
o Critical fireground factors
 Considering elapsed time into the incident
o Risk Management position
o Strategy
o Evaluation of the incident action plan (is there a plan B?)
o Resources
 Consider remaining onscene firefighters welfare
o Plan and prepare for communications challenges
 Mayday initiated on wrong radio channel
 Multiple, simultaneous Maydays

The tactical benchmark for the end point of a Mayday is “Mayday resolved”. The critical points that have to be
confirmed prior to giving the benchmark of “Mayday resolved” is:





The Officer of the individual sector in which the Mayday occurred has the responsibility to notify command of the
completion of the rescue and that all members involved are out of the hazard zone. The Incident Commander has
the obligation to complete the accountability process for the entire incident and complete the benchmark
“Mayday resolved”.
Dispatch Center Responsibilities
It is critical to acknowledge the role the dispatch center and most specifically the tactical radio operators will have
in the resolution of a Mayday. A significant component of the overall hazard zone management system and
firefighter safety is the contact between the incident command team and the dispatch center, no matter the
incident size. The tactical radio operator responsibilities for a Mayday response are as follows:





A Mayday is initiated by a member in the field communicating “Mayday, Mayday, Mayday” on the radio
A Mayday can be initiated by anyone, at anytime working in the field and has access to a portable radio
Mayday is not just a fireground term, it can be used in any hazard zone
Upon initiation of a Mayday, the tactical radio operator shall:
o Transmit the emergency traffic tone
o Voice on the tactical channel: “We have a Mayday on the scene, all units hold your traffic”
o Repeats the Mayday message using the standard radio order model
o Allows for the Incident Commander to speak to the Mayday initiator
 If the first Fire Department Company onscene of a fire incident initiates the Mayday, the tactical radio
operator shall:
o Assures the member that “help is on the way”
o Maintains communications with the Mayday initiator until other units arrive
 Ensure the communications are necessary and not to fill dead radio time
o Reminds the member to initiate their “GRAB LIVES” procedures
o Ensures all responding units are aware of the Mayday
o Upgrades the assignment to a Mayday nature code
 The entire dispatch center provides redundant monitoring of the Mayday radio traffic
 The dispatch center provides some automatic activation of processes to assist with a Mayday incident.
These include:
o Additional resources
 Upon the initiation of a Mayday, the incident is upgraded using the Mayday nature code
 If 3 – 1 incident, then balanced to 1st Alarm Mayday
 If 1st Alarm incident, then balanced to 2nd Alarm Mayday
 Continues to 9 Alarms
 Provide additional medical or transport resources as appropriate
o Monitoring of all possible hazard zone channels

Purpose
Operating at emergency incidents poses an inherent risk of injury – or worse, death. The
purpose of this procedure is to describe the Regional Operating Procedure regarding risk
assessment and safety management of emergency incidents. We are committed to providing
the safest possible work environment for our members. It is important that all members
operating at incidents operate in a safe manner. Each member is responsible for their own
safety and to work within the incident action plan to maintain effective accountability and
effective coordination of action. Towards that goal, all members are expected to operate under
the following Risk Management Plan.
Procedure
All operating personnel shall work within a standard Risk Management Plan during all
emergency operations on every emergency incident. This application will be continuously re‐
assessed at all levels of the incident until all units leave the scene.
1. We Will risk our lives a lot, in a calculated manner, to save savable lives.
2. We Will risk our lives a Little, in a calculated manner, to save savable property.
3. We Will Not risk our lives at all for lives or property that are already Lost.
“Actions in a calculated manner” require the following:








Continual use of the Strategic Decision Making Model
Incident Command established
Proper personal protective equipment
Accountability system established
Safety procedures in place
Continuous risk assessment by all members
Uninterrupted Communications

Operational Information
The position in the risk management plan represents the “why” are we taking risk at this
incident. It must be clear to all companies, working at all levels of the incident command
system, that the incident strategy and plans are focused on either savable lives or savable

property. The recognition through an effective size‐up that savable lives may be present at an
incident and that the conditions exist that the fire crews can provide a rescue is a situation that
has the greatest allowable threshold for risk. The questions that are necessary to determine
this level of risk are:




Is it reasonable to believe that there are savable lives present at this incident?
Are there any survivable environments or compartments at this incident?
Do we have the resources and ability to affect a rescue and survive to complete it?

For fire incidents, a quick and overwhelming attack on the fire, from any reasonable position,
may be the best thing for mitigating significant risk an allowing the opportunity for rescue and
firefighter survivability.
If the incident size‐up has determined neither, savable lives or savable property are present
because of the conditions, no or very limited risk shall be taken within a defensive strategy.
This risk management plan is effective and necessary for all types of hazards and incidents. This
includes:





Large scale medical incidents
Hazardous materials incidents
Technical rescue incidents
Violent incidents

UL-FSRI: There is No Substitute for Knowledge
CHEMISTRY OF FIRE
Fire: The term “fire” refers to how something burns. Fire is a rapid oxidation process, which is a
chemical reaction resulting in the evolution of light and heat in varying intensities.
Combustion: Combustion is a chemical process of oxidation that occurs at a rate fast enough to
produce heat and usually light in the form of either a glow or flame.
Modes of Combustion: Fire and combustion are similar conditions; however, combustion can
occur without fire.
There are two modes of combustion, non-flaming and flaming.

FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 1 of 29

Non-Flaming Combustion: Non-flaming combustion occurs more slowly and at a lower
temperature producing a smoldering glow in the material’s surface without flames.
Flaming Combustion: Flaming combustion is commonly referred to as fire because it produces a
visible flame above the material’s surface.
Fire Models: Two models, the fire triangle and fire tetrahedron are used to explain the elements
of fire and how fires can be extinguished.
Fire Triangle: The oldest and simplest model, the fire triangle,
illustrates the three elements necessary for combustion to occur:
fuel, oxygen and heat. Remove any one of these elements and
combustion will cease. The fire triangle best illustrates the
elements required for non-flaming combustion; when burning is
localized on or near the fuel’s surface where it is in contact with
oxygen. Examples of non-flaming combustion include burning
charcoal briquettes or smoldering wood or fabric.
Fire Tetrahedron: Research into fire behavior has determined that an uninhibited chemical chain
reaction must also be present in addition to the other elements of the fire triangle (fuel, oxygen
& heat) in order for flames to occur. Therefore, the fire
tetrahedron was created to explain flaming combustion.
Each element of the fire tetrahedron; fuel, oxygen, heat &
uninhibited chemical chain reaction must be present for
flaming combustion. Removing any element of the
tetrahedron interrupts the chemical chain reaction and
stops flaming combustion.
Fuel: Fuel may be found in any of three states of matter:
solid, liquid, or gas. Only gases burn. For a solid or liquid
to burn, they must be converted into a gas. Solids are
converted into gas by pyrolysis and Liquids are converted to a gas by vaporization.
Pyrolysis: Pyrolysis is the chemical
decomposition of a solid material that is
caused by the absorption of heat. When
pyrolysis of a material occurs, gas is released
from the solid material. Pyrolysis often
precedes combustion.

FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 2 of 29

Surface to Mass Ratio: significantly affects the ease
of ignition of solid fuels.
Vaporization: Liquids are converted into gas by
vaporization. Examples of vaporization include
boiling water or water in a container evaporating in
sunlight. In both cases, heat causes the liquid to vaporize.
Heat Energy: The transfer or flow due to the difference in temperature between two objects is
called heat. Heat energy is a form of energy characterized by vibration of molecules and capable
of initiating and supporting chemical changes and changes of state. In other words, it is the
energy needed to change temperature of an object(s) – add heat, temperature increases; remove
heat, temperature decreases.
Temperature: Temperature is a measure of the degree of molecular activity of a material
compared to a reference point. Temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit or degrees
Celsius.
Heat Release Rate: Heat release rate (HRR) is the rate at which fire releases energy – this is also
known as power. HRR is measured in units of Watts (W), which is an International System unit
equal to one Joule per second.
Temperature vs Heat Release Rate: One candle vs ten candles – same flame temperature but 10
times the heat release rate (see below). Both examples are producing 930° F - 2500° F in
temperature. The single candle is producing ~ 80 W HRR. The ten candles are producing ~800
W HRR.

UL-FSRI: Understanding the Basics: Heat Release Rate vs Temperature
Surface to Volume Ratio: Surface to volume ration significantly affects the ease of ignition of
liquid fuels. The greater the surface area compared to volume, the faster the liquid will vaporize.
An example of this is a gallon of gasoline within a small steel container sitting on the floor in the
FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 3 of 29

middle of a room (smaller surface area) or a gallon of gasoline spilled out on a floor all over the
room (larger surface area). The fire in the container will not produce the same volume of fire as
the floor that is covered in gasoline.
Gaseous fuels can be the most dangerous because they are already in the natural state required
for ignition. No pyrolysis or vaporization will be needed to ready the fuel. These fuels are also
the most difficult to contain.
Oxygen: Oxygen in the air is the primary oxidizing agent in most fires. Normally, air consists of
20.8% oxygen. At normal ambient temperatures, materials can ignite and burn at oxygen
concentrations as low as 15 percent. When oxygen concentration is reduced below 15%, the
flaming combustion will diminish, causing combustion to continue in the non-flaming mode.
This means that below 15% there will not be visible flames, but because combustion continues
in the non-flaming mode, heat and dense, fuel rich smoke will continue to be produced. If
oxygen is introduced to this type of atmosphere, the fuel rich environment can ignite and be
hazardous to firefighters.
Some fires involve fuels that contain chemical oxidizers (their own oxygen source) such as
Ammonium Nitrate Fertilizer and Hydrogen Peroxide. These compounds can cause rapid
burning rates, flame spread and explosions when they breakdown and do not depend on oxygen
in the air to burn.
When oxygen concentration is higher than 20.8%, materials exhibit very different burning
characteristics. Materials that burn at normal oxygen levels will burn more intensely in oxygenenriched atmospheres. Many materials that do not burn at all in normal oxygen levels, may
burn readily in oxygen-enriched atmospheres. Nomex, a fire-resistant fabric used in our PPE
does not burn readily in normal oxygen concentrations. When placed in an oxygen enriched
atmosphere, Nomex ignites and burns vigorously. Some petroleum-based materials may ignite
spontaneously without an external heat source in oxygen-enriched atmospheres.
HEAT TRANSFER: A number of natural laws of physics are involved in the transmission of heat.
One is called the Law of Heat Flow; it specifies that heat always flows from a hot substance to a
cold substance. The colder of two objects in contact with each other will absorb heat until both
objects are at the same temperature.
Heat can travel throughout a building by one or more of three methods: conduction, convection,
and radiation. The following sections describe how this heat transfer takes place.

FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 4 of 29

CONDUCTION

CONVECTION

RADIATION

Conduction: Heat may be conducted from one body to
another by direct contact of two objects or by an
intervening heat-conducting medium (material). An
example of this type of heat transfer is a cellar fire that
heats pipes enough that the pipes ignite the wood
inside walls remote from the fire. Another example is
firefighters crawling on a hot floor that burn their
knees.

CONDUCTION

Convection: Convection is the transfer of heat by the movement of air or liquid. When water is
heated in a container, it expands and grows lighter, hence, the upward movement. Heated air in
a building will expand (creating pressure) and rise. For this reason, fire spread by convection is
mostly in an upward direction; however, air currents can carry heat in any direction. Convection
currents are generally the cause of heat movement, from room to room, from floor to floor and
from area to area. The spread of fire through corridors, up stairwells, and elevator shafts;
between walls, and through attics is caused mostly by the convection of heat currents.

FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 5 of 29

CONVECTION
Radiation: Radiation describes heat transfer through the movement of heat waves. Heat and
light waves will cause radiated heat to travel through a space until it reaches an object.

RADIATION
As the object is exposed to heat radiation, it will in return radiate heat from its surface. Radiated
heat is one of the major sources of fire spread to exposures. Radiated heat is also one of the
major causes of firefighter burn injuries and flashover in a compartment fire.

UL-FSRI Understanding How Heat Transfers Through Turnout Gear
Uninhibited Chemical Chain Reaction: The last part of the Fire Tetrahedron is the self-sustained
uninhibited chemical chain reaction involved in flaming combustion. Understand that a
chemical chain reaction occurs when fuels are broken down by heat and the reaction will cause
the fire to continue to burn until the fuel or oxygen is exhausted, or an extinguishing agent is
applied in sufficient quantity to interfere with the ongoing reaction.
Extinguishment Theory: The extinguishment of fire is carried out by limiting or removing one or
more of the essential elements in the combustion process (removing one of the sides of the fire
FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 6 of 29

triangle or tetrahedron). This is accomplished by one of four methods: heat reduction, fuel
removal, oxygen removal or chemical flame inhibition.
Heat Reduction: The most common method used to accomplish extinguishment is the
application of water. This process of extinguishment is dependent on reducing the temperature
of the fuel to a point where it does not produce sufficient vapor to burn.

Fuel Removal: In some cases, a fire is effectively extinguished by removing the fuel source.
Removal of the fuel source may be accomplished by stopping the flow of liquid or gaseous fuel
or by removing solid fuel in the path of the fire. Another method of fuel removal is to allow the
fire to burn until the fuel is consumed.
Extinguishment by Oxygen Reduction: Reducing the oxygen content in an area also
extinguishes the fire. Reduction of the oxygen content can be accomplished by flooding an area
with an inert gas, such as carbon dioxide, which displaces the oxygen; or the oxygen can be
reduced by separating the fuel from the air such as by blanketing it with foam or placing a cover
on a pot. None of these methods work on those rare fuels that are self-oxidizing.
Extinguishment by Chemical Flame Inhibition: Some extinguishing agents, such as dry chemical
(sodium bicarbonate) and older systems such as Halon (halogenated hydrocarbons), interrupt
the flame-producing chemical reaction and stop flaming. This method of extinguishment is
effective on gas and liquid fuels, because they must flame to burn. Smoldering fires are not
easily extinguished by this method because
non-flaming combustion (represented by the
fire triangle) does not require the presence of
the chemical chain reaction present in flaming
combustion (represented by the fire
tetrahedron). Cooling is the preferred way to
extinguish a smoldering fire.

FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 7 of 29

Classes of Fires

Solid Fuel Combustion: As solid fuels are exposed to heat, they absorb energy and increase in
temperature. As the temperature of the solid rises, the solid fuel begins to decompose and
break down. When it breaks down, it releases gas. Solid fuel when exposed to enough heat,
will transform into a gas. The gas ignites and produces fire during flaming combustion.
Pyrolysis: The chemical decomposition of a solid material that is caused by the absorption of
heat. When pyrolysis of a material occurs, gas is released from the solid material. Pyrolysis
often precedes combustion.
Liquid Fuel Combustion: For liquid fuels to burn, they must release vapors and those vapors
must mix with air so that the concentration of fuel is within the explosive/flammable range. A
liquid fuel with a higher vapor pressure generates more fuel vapor than a liquid fuel with a lower
vapor pressure. If heat is added to a fuel vapor, once the fuel concentration is within the
explosive/flammable range, it is possible for it to ignite. A fire may then begin and grow
wherever a flammable mixture is present.
FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 8 of 29

Flash Point: The lowest temperature of a liquid at which that liquid gives off sufficient vapors to
ignite but will not continue to burn. Liquid fuels are classified according to their fire hazard
characteristics. The classifications are based on the flash point of the liquid. Depending on the
flash point temperature, liquids are grouped as to whether they are flammable (more of a
hazard) or combustible liquids (less of a hazard).
Flammable Liquid: A flammable liquid is a liquid that has a flash point below 100’F
Combustible Liquid: A combustible liquid is a liquid that has a flash point equal to or greater
than 100’F.
Fire Point: Fire point is the lowest temperature at which a liquid will ignite and achieve sustained
burning.
Vapor Pressure: Vapor pressure is the ability of a liquid or solid fuel to vaporize. The higher the
vapor pressure, the more vapors are released (the easier it is to off-gas).
Vapor Density: The vapor density of gas refers to its density compared to air. Gases that have a
vapor density around 1 will mix evenly with air. A gas with a vapor density greater than 1 is
heavier than air. It will sink and collect in low areas. Gases that have vapor densities less than 1
are lighter than air and will rise to the top of a compartment.
Gaseous Fuel Combustion: In a fire, oxygen must chemically react with combustible fuel in a
rapid oxidation process. For flaming combustion to begin and continue, the concentration of
fuel vapor in the burning mixture (air and fuel) must be between the upper and lower explosive
limits for that fuel. When the concentration of fuel in the air lies between the lower explosive
limit (LEL) and the upper explosive limit (UEL), there is danger of the fuel igniting if a flame or
other ignition source is present.
Lower Explosive Limit (LEL): The lower explosive limit is the lowest concentration by volume of
flammable gas in air that will support flame propagation. This is also known as lower
flammability limit.
Upper Explosive Limit (UEL): The upper explosive limit is the highest concentration by volume
of flammable gas in air that will support flame propagation. This is also known as upper
flammability limit.
Explosive Range (aka Flammable Range): The range of gas to air mixtures in which ignition can
occur. It is the range of gas to air mixture that exists between the lower explosive limit and the
upper explosive limit.

FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 9 of 29

Compartment Fire Development: To help understand fire behavior, the development of a fire in
a compartment (room/enclosure etc.) has been broken down into 4 different stages:
•
•
•
•

Incipient Stage
Growth Stage
Fully Developed Stage
Decay Stage

In each of these stages, the fire will have
discernable characteristics (different fire
conditions) which are used to identify the
stage the fire is in. Since certain fire
phenomenon are likely to occur during
certain stages of fire development, a
firefighter’s understanding and ability to identify these stages will help the firefighter better size
up fire conditions and make better tactical decisions on the fireground. It is important to note
that while most fires will pass through all 4 stages, some fires may not, e.g.: An arson fire may
begin in the growth stage. In addition, some fires may pass through some stages more than one
time. E.g.: A fire in the decay stage may redevelop into the growth stage following ventilation.
Incipient Stage: The incipient stage is the earliest stage of a fire and begins with the actual
ignition. The fire is generally small during this stage and burning is usually limited to the original
materials of ignition. During this stage of fire development, radiant heat warms the adjacent
fuels and continues the process of pyrolysis, increasing the volume of fire. A plume of hot
gasses and flame rise from the fire and mixes with the cooler air in the room. As this plume
reaches the ceiling, hot gasses begin to spread horizontally across the ceiling.
In the incipient stage, there is plenty of oxygen and fuel available to burn. Oxygen levels in the
air have not been significantly reduced by the fire. Some heat is being generated but the
temperature in the room may only slightly increase. Incipient fires can be readily extinguished
with the use of the proper fire extinguisher. It is essential to recognize that the transition from
an incipient fire into the growth stage can occur quickly (sometimes in seconds) depending on
the type and configuration of fuel involved.
FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 10 of 29

Growth Stage: The growth stage covers a wide spectrum of fire development. It is the period
that usually begins when the original fire spreads to additional materials. As the fire grows, it
may spread to other objects by any combination of heat transfer (conduction, convection or
radiation), by direct flame impingement, or if foams or plastic materials are involved, they can
melt, and drip liquid which is on fire. This burning liquid can pool on the floor while burning
and ignite secondary items.
Similar to the incipient stage,
during the growth stage there is
plenty of oxygen and fuel available
to burn. During the very
beginning of this stage, oxygen
levels in the room may not have
been significantly reduced by the
fire. Oxygen rich air will be drawn
into the flame as convection
carries the heat to the uppermost
regions of the confined area.
The presence of this heated air will cause the temperature to begin to rise in the area and if left
unchecked, may start a series of events that will lead to
rapid fire development and flame spread. Rollover and
flashover occur during the Growth Stage.
Fully Developed Stage (Full Room Involvement): After a
compartment fire has flashed over, the fire that remains
within the compartment which has flashed over is
considered to be in the fully developed stage. The
burning fuels in the compartment are releasing the maximum amount of heat possible for the
available fuel and/or oxygen, producing large volumes of fire gases. These gases may travel
throughout the building and into building voids while mixed into heavy smoke. The larger the
volume of fire and larger the volume of smoke produced; the larger the impact on survivability
will be, even in remote areas of the building.
Flammable products of combustion are likely to flow
from the fire room into adjacent rooms or out through
openings to the exterior of the building. Flames will
extend out of the compartment openings because
there is insufficient oxygen for complete combustion
within the compartment itself.

FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 11 of 29

Note: The fire is only fully developed within the compartment(s) that has flashed over. Fire
spreading out of this compartment into other compartments or rooms may be in the growth
stage and subject to additional rollover and flashover conditions.
Decay Stage (Fuel Limited or Ventilation Limited): A fire enters the decay stage when all of the
available fuel is consumed or when the oxygen concentration falls below 15% and flaming
combustion is diminished. Both of these situations can result in the combustion reaction
coming to a stop and the fire being completely extinguished if fuel or oxygen is never
introduced. However, if a fire enters the decay stage due to reduced oxygen concentration,
which is very common in the modern fire environment, any change in the ventilation of the
compartment that adds oxygen before combustion has completely ceased, can cause the fire to
rapidly redevelop. It is important to note that the cause for any fire to enter the decay stage is
because the fire is either fuel limited or ventilation limited.
Fuel Limited: If there is adequate ventilation and the fire consumes the available fuel in the
compartment to the point that the heat release rate begins to decline, the fire enters the decay
stage. This is because whatever fuel was burning has been entirely consumed and there is no
additional fuel to burn. The fire has become fuel controlled.
Ventilation Limited: If there is adequate fuel available and the fire consumes enough of the
available oxygen in the compartment, the heat release rate will also begin to decline, and the fire
will enter the decay stage because the flames do not have enough oxygen. There is still plenty
of fuel that is available to burn, and the fuel, even while it is smoldering, is pyrolyzing and
emitting a large volume of flammable gases into the compartment. In this situation, if no
oxygen is introduced, after a lengthy time, combustion will cease and the fire will be completely
extinguished. However, if oxygen is introduced before combustion has ceased, rapid fire
development and/or backdraft may result.
UL-FSRI: Fire Development Changes

When a Fire Becomes Ventilation

THERMAL LAYERING
Thermal Layering: The thermal
layering of gases is the tendency of
gases to form into layers according to
temperature. The hottest gases tend
to be near the top of the layering,
while the cooler ones make up the bottom. Other terms that are sometimes used to describe
this layering of gases are “heat stratification” and “thermal balance”.
FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 12 of 29

Thermal layering inside a compartment fire, is further broken down into two separate categories:
The upper layer which is composed of the hot fire gases and the lower layer which is the cooler
air below the hot fire gases. It is important to understand these terms for tactical reasons e.g. a
thermal imaging camera can identify the thermal interface if the camera itself is positioned in the
lower layer (cooler layer) looking at the upper layer (hot layer). A camera held in the hot layer
will not be able to see the thermal interface.
Upper Layer: Buoyant smoke and gases collected by the ceiling and walls of an enclosure that
begin to form a relatively uniform layer of heated smoke and gases throughout the upper area of
a compartment.
As a fire develops in a compartment, over time, the hot rising smoke and fire gases spread
across the ceiling and mushroom down into the room as they collect in a thick, relatively
uniformed layer of hot gases throughout the upper layers of the enclosure.
Once the upper hot layer is formed, the additional flow of gases from the fire continues to collect
along the ceiling forcing the upper layer to descend downward into the room as the fire heat
release rate and upper layer temperatures increase.
Decreasing the heat of the fire within the enclosure will decrease the temperature and formation
of hot gases that collect in the upper layer. If the heat is reduced, it can result in the contraction
of gases in the upper layer. The contraction of upper layer gas volume will cause the upper
layer to lift.
Directly decreasing the temperature of the upper layer (i.e., through the application of water) will
also result in a contraction of the upper layer gas volume as a result of the hot smoke cooling.
This can delay or prevent flashover.
Lower Layer: The lower layer is the zone beneath the upper layer which consists primarily of
ambient air that is entrained into the fire.
The cooler lower layer consists of air, at temperature and humidity levels closer to ambient
conditions, drawn in through ventilation openings in the enclosure. As the hot gases rise in the
buoyant plume, the cooler air is pulled in towards the fire.
THERMAL INTERFACE AND INTERFACE HEIGHT
Thermal Interface: The boundary between the upper and lower layers which is represented by a
sharp transition from the hot smoke in the upper layer to the cool ambient air of the lower layer
is called the Thermal Interface.
FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 13 of 29

Interface Height: The vertical distance from the floor of the enclosure to the thermal interface.

Neutral Plane: The flow of smoke and fire gases through an opening is described as either
unidirectional or bidirectional. Unidirectional flow occurs when the flow through the opening
flows in one direction only (either into or out of the opening). Bidirectional flow occurs when an
opening acts as both an inlet and an outlet for flows at the same time.

The horizontal line along a window or door or other ventilation opening where no flow occurs
due to the equality of internal and external pressures. Above the neutral plane the flow of
smoke and gases will be outwards and below the neutral plane the flow of cool air will be
inwards.

The volume of hot smoke generated by the fire largely
determines the pressure distribution in the
compartment under fire conditions. As the hot smoke
rises and accumulates, the pressure at the ceiling will
rise. Similarly, the pressure at the floor will be lower, as
cool air is entrained. Above the neutral plane the
pressure inside the enclosure will be higher than the
exterior pressure and cause the direction of flow to be
outward. Similarly, below the neutral plane the
pressure inside the enclosure will be less than the exterior pressure, and the flow of cool air will
be inward toward the fire.
The horizontal line between the inflow and outflow at a ventilation opening (i.e., at the plane
where there is zero pressure difference and thus zero flow in or out of the opening) is known as
the neutral plane. The position of the neutral plane can often be observed during a fire, given
that the outflow often consists of visible smoke or fire.
Note: The neutral plane is different from the thermal interface because the neutral plane only
occurs at a ventilation opening. Neutral plane indicates pressure differences at an opening and
may be used by firefighters outside the building to help determine the fire location within a
building.

Thermal Interface and interface height refer to the separation between the hot upper layer and
the cool lower layer within a compartment. Thermal Interface and the interface height indicate
heat differences (how much volume of a compartment is filled with heat). It can be used by
firefighters to identify how far the hot upper layer has banked down and the possibility of
flashover.
SMOKE: The smoke encountered at most fires consists of a mixture of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon
dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, finely divided carbon particles (soot), and a
miscellaneous assortment of products that have been released from the material involved.
Two of the most toxic gases are carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide which are both
chemical asphyxiants and are responsible for many fire deaths. These gases are highly toxic
and pose a significant threat to human life.
The combination of fire gases produced during combustion and present in smoke are flammable
and contribute greatly to rapid fire development. For this reason, firefighters shall consider
smoke to be additional fuel.
When air is heated it becomes more buoyant (hot air rises). In addition to buoyancy, more than
three-quarters of air is made up of nitrogen. The energy released by the fire causes the nitrogen
to expand which drives a significant increase in the volume of the air.
The buoyancy of hot air and expansion of nitrogen can push significant volumes of smoke
through openings to the exterior or to other parts of the structure. Because smoke is suspended
in air, the smoke is a visible indicator of how much hot air is rising and how fast the nitrogen is
expanding. The value of “reading smoke” is tremendous in performing a size up of the fire.
To accurately size up a fire by reading smoke, a firefighter must evaluate five characteristics of
the smoke: Volume, Velocity, Density, Color and Stratification.
Smoke Volume: In many instances, smoke may be the only visible indicator of a fire. The
volume of smoke may indicate the size, location and stage of the fire within a structure.
However, the volume of smoke may not always be visible and can be concealed by various
building configurations.
Smoke Velocity: Smoke velocity is an indicator of pressure that has built up within a structure.
The pressure is developed by buoyancy and expansion due to the amount of heat released by
the fire. Smoke flow can be either laminar (smooth) or turbulent based on the velocity and
temperature. Cooler smoke appears to flow smoother. Hotter smoke will appear to boil and
move quickly upwards in a turbulent fashion.
FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 16 of 29

A. Turbulent Smoke indicates extreme heat (closer to the fire)
B. Laminar Smoke indicates low heat (either because it is a small fire, or the smoke is
remote from the fire and has cooled)

LAMINAR SMOKE

TURBULENT SMOKE

Smoke Density: The apparent density “thickness” of the smoke can be a good indicator of the
efficiency of the combustion process. In the early fuel-limited stages where there is plenty of
oxygen, the rate of smoke production is lower than in later stages when the fire is becoming
ventilation-limited. A large fire which is severely ventilation limited, will produce large volumes
of thick dense smoke.
A. Dense smoke can indicate the fire is a ventilation-limited fire.
SMOKE COLOR
Black: Dark smoke often indicates fuel-rich conditions, due to restricted air supply (ventilation
limited). Where flaming or smoldering combustion occurs, the carbon in the fuel is released as
soot in the smoke, resulting in a very dark color. If the air supply is sufficient, more of the
carbon will react and will produce a lighter colored smoke and brighter flame. If air supply is
restricted, less carbon reacts and becomes suspended in the smoke producing a darker colored
smoke.
Thick dark smoke indicates an abundance of fuel that was not burned in the fire and is now
suspended in the smoke. Given the right conditions, this suspended fuel can ignite.
Brown: Brown smoke can indicate the early stages of the pyrolysis of timber products. The
brown color is caused by the process of wood breaking down. In a wood framed building, the
presence of brown smoke may indicate that the structure is involved.
Grey: Grey smoke indicates that at least some flaming combustion or smoldering combustion is
present. Dark smoke that has travelled some distance can cool and large carbon particles
suspended in the smoke can adhere to surfaces. The further the smoke travels, the more carbon

FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 17 of 29

it can lose, resulting in a grey smoke. In a building issuing dark smoke from some areas and
grey smoke from other areas, usually the areas with grey smoke are remote from the fire.
White: Application of water to a large fire will generate large amounts of steam which can mix
with smoke and create condensation that gives the appearance of white smoke. In this situation,
the white color can indicate water is on the fire. The more white condensation that is visible,
combined with a reduction in the volume and velocity of dark smoke, indicates progress is being
made in extinguishment.
White smoke (not steam) is produced when certain fuels are heated to their pyrolysis
temperature and volatile components are released. If the heat continues to increase and there is
insufficient oxygen even for smoldering combustion, then the production of white smoke will
continue. White smoke can have a very high fuel content (white ghost), represents a significant
danger, and should never be treated lightly. When white smoke mixes with oxygen and finds an
ignition source, there is potential for a very sudden and powerful ignition.
Smoke Stratification:
A. Smoke usually stratifies in layers sometimes corresponding with the upper and lower
layer. As a fire develops within an enclosure, the thermal interface will lower. The
interface height can usually be observed by observing the smoke stratification or using
the thermal imaging camera.
B. The location of the interface (its height in the room) and the neutral plane is important
when assessing the potential for rapid fire development.
1. A high interface could indicate the fire is in early stages of development or that
you are remote from the fire area.
2. A sudden rise in the interface could indicate that ventilation has occurred.
3. Gradual lowering of the interface often indicates a buildup of hot fire gases, a
situation that could progress to rollover and flashover if left uncontrolled.
4. A sudden lowering of the interface could indicate a rapid intensification of the fire.
5. A neutral plane that is at or near floor level may indicate that the fire is on a floor
below.
FLOW PATH & FIRE TRAVEL
The flow path of a fire describes the route that smoke and flame move away from the seat of the
fire toward any outlet(s), as well as the corresponding flow of air into the fire from any inlet(s).
Normal Air inside a compartment is made up of gases (such as oxygen and nitrogen). When this
air is heated, the gases expand, and the expansion of gases create pressure.
Flow Path: The area(s) within a structure fire where fire, heat, smoke and air flows from an area
of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure.

FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 18 of 29

Flow Path Management: It is possible to reduce the rate of fire growth if the inlet(s) and/or
outlet(s) can be closed or restricted. In addition, the purposeful management of the flow path
can increase firefighter safety during operations.
There may be several flow paths within a structure depending upon the building design and the
available ventilation openings (i.e. doors, windows, shafts). The flow within the flow path may
be characterized as being unidirectional, bidirectional or dynamic. The shape and position of the
smoke/air track at a vent opening can be an important indicator of the intensity of the fire.
Velocity and Direction: When an opening is created in a fire area, the heated gases will flow out
of the top of the opening, and cool air will flow in through the bottom of the opening.
A sudden inward movement of the air track could indicate the potential for rapid fire
development. In these cases, the sudden inward rush of air will cause the fire to intensify and be
followed by an outward rush of smoke and/or flame.
Smoke or flame being discharged from the entire ventilation opening (no neutral plane visible)
usually indicates that it is an outlet and that there is at least one inlet located somewhere else in
the structure.
An opening that is both a ventilation inlet and outlet will show signs of laminar (smooth) or
turbulent flow at the neutral plane depending on the stage and intensity of the fire.
A. Unidirectional Flow
A unidirectional flow is a flow of smoke, flame or air moving in a single direction across
the full area of the opening. A unidirectional flow path can exist as either an exhaust or
an inlet.
B. Bidirectional Flow
Bidirectional flow describes a smoke/air flow moving in opposing directions within the
same openings.
C. Dynamic Flow
A unidirectional or bidirectional flow of smoke/air that presents irregular stratification and
shape, or alternates in direction (pulsates) is identified as dynamic flow.
Under normal fire conditions, there should be a clearly identified unidirectional flow or clearly
delineated bidirectional flow of smoke/flame from a vent opening.
Under normal wind conditions, a room with only one opening will display a bidirectional
smoke/air track with a visible neutral plane. In a wind-impacted scenario, the opening can
aggressively alternate from a total inlet to a total exhaust outlet with a range of unique vent
profiles. This would be an example of Dynamic Flow.

DANGEROUS FIRE EVENTS
Generally speaking, in a developing
compartment fire, rollover occurs
before flashover. Understanding
and being able to recognize rollover
and flashover conditions and being
able to identify a ventilation-induced
flashover environment and other
dangerous fire events are key factors
in Fire Dynamics Size-Up. The
following section will describe dangerous fire events such as rollover, flashover, ventilationinduced flashover, backdraft, black fire, smoke explosion, flash fire, BLEVE and Boilover.
Rollover
As the fire develops and the thermal layer has been formed, pockets of flame may begin to form
in the upper layer as the first indication that unburned fuel in the hot smoke may be coming
close to its auto-ignition temperature. If it does ignite, a rollover occurs.
Rollover: A condition where the unburned fire gases that have accumulated at the top of a
compartment ignite and flames travel through the hot gas layer across the ceiling.
Rollover is when the heated gasses rising from the fire accumulate at the ceiling level. These
heated gases are pushed, under pressure, and spread horizontally across the ceiling. While
these gasses are banking down, they are forming the upper layer and are mixing with oxygen.
The upper layer becomes a flammable mixture of heated gases. When their flammable range is
reached, they ignite and a fire develops, with fire expanding very rapidly and rolling over the
ceiling away from the main body of fire. Rollover occurs during the growth stage.
Rollover is different from flashover because in rollover primarily the gasses are burning not the
entire contents of the room. However, during a rollover event, such a significant amount of
radiant heat (energy) is added to the room, that usually within seconds, flashover will occur. For
this reason, the presence of rollover indicates that flashover is imminent.

FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 20 of 29

FLASHOVER
Flashover is a transition phase in the development of a compartment fire in which surfaces
exposed to thermal radiation reach ignition temperatures and ignite more or less
simultaneously.
Flashover: The simultaneous ignition of all of the combustible materials in a compartment and
all of the gases built up in the compartment produced by pyrolysis.
During flashover, the environment of the room is changing from a two-layer condition (Upper
Layer and Lower Layer/ hot on top, cooler on the bottom) to a single well mixed, untenable hot
gas condition from floor to ceiling. The temperature in the compartment typically exceeds 1100’
F. In order for flashover to occur, there must be an enclosed space such as a single room.
Virtually all combustible surfaces in the enclosed space become ignited during flashover.
The transition period between pre-flashover fire conditions to post-flashover can occur rapidly.
During flashover, the volume of fire will increase to fill the entire volume of space in the room;
with fire and burning gases likely extending out of any openings in the room (windows, doors,
etc.) with substantial velocity.
Flashover occurs during the growth stage. Once flashover has occurred, the fire within the
compartment is said to be in the Fully Developed Stage.
Note: The Geometry (the size, shape and volume) of a room affects the formation of the upper
layer and thus the heat transfer within a given fire compartment. A flashover may take longer to
occur in compartments that have
peaked ceilings or cathedral
ceilings since these features make it
difficult for the upper layer to form.
Lack of upper layer formation limits
the amount of radiant heat
produced and radiated back
towards the fire and other fuels in
the compartment.
Ventilation-Induced Flashover:
When a fire enters the decay stage
before flashover occurs due to a
reduction in oxygen, but then redevelops and flashover occurs when oxygen is admitted to the
fire, is called a ventilation-induced flashover.

FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 21 of 29

Ventilation-Induced Flashover: A flashover initiated by the introduction of oxygen into a preheated, fuel rich (smoke filled) oxygen deficient area.
Ventilation-Induced Flashover has become prevalent with modern content fires. Modern content
fires rapidly consume more of the available oxygen within the fire compartment creating
conditions favorable for a ventilation-induced flashover to occur.
Ventilation-Induced Flashover occurs when oxygen is introduced to a fire which has entered an
early decay stage. Once ventilation-induced flashover occurs, the fire within the compartment is
said to be in the Fully Developed Stage.
Ventilation-Induced Flashover is similar to a backdraft except a backdraft involves significantly
more pressure, causing an explosion.

Ventilation will initially relieve built up heat and smoke even when conducted ahead of hoseline
operations. While all ventilation openings may have an impact on the fire, a member taking a
window of a fire room in the oxygen deficient early decay stage will have more immediate effect
on fire regrowth than opening the fire apartment door down the hall. If water is not applied to
the seat of the fire soon after ventilation occurs, this temporary improvement period may be
followed by a rapid deterioration of conditions, potentially leading to flashover.

FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 22 of 29

In oxygen depleted environments, this temporary improvement period can last for an
unspecified amount of time; it can be seconds or several minutes. It is important to note that
there is no way to accurately
determine how long this temporary
improvement period will last. Factors
impacting fire rapid re-growth include
size and location of the fire, size and
location of the ventilation opening,
building dynamics and flow paths
established between the fire and
ventilation opening(s). Firefighters can
extend the temporary improvement
period by coordinating ventilation with
fire attack.

Black Fire: The occurrence of Black Fire is a condition when thick, turbulent superheated fuel rich
black smoke has been heated well beyond its ignition point but is so rich with gasses it is
beyond its flammable range and is too rich to burn. Black Fire occurs in areas of the fire building
which are said to be in the Growth Stage. This can and often does include areas above or
adjacent to rooms of fire that are fully involved and in the fully developed stage.
It is called Black Fire because at the area affected there will be no visible flames, just dark black
superheated turbulent smoke. The smoke will be so hot that it will act as if it were fire. This
means that the heat from Black Fire will be searing and destructive and it will pyrolyze and
consume materials in its path. It can severely burn firefighters.
When Black Fire conditions are present, there is usually an area ahead of the Black Fire area
where the main body of fire is free burning and heavily involved in flames. In the Black Fire Area
FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 23 of 29

itself, the smoke will be too rich to burn and there will be no visible flames. Behind the Black Fire
area, as the smoke travels remote from the fire area and mixes with more air, there may be an
area where the smoke ignites. This ignition can occur in a room behind firefighters who are
operating in the black fire area causing them to become trapped. Ignition can also occur on the
exterior of the building when the smoke ignites as it is released from a window or door and
mixes with air in the atmosphere. This is known as vent point ignition.
Black Fire is an extremely dangerous condition to be operating in. Upon recognition of Black
Fire Conditions, treat the Black Fire smoke as if it were flames. Immediately flow water into the
smoke layer with a hoseline to aggressively cool the area. If you are unable to immediately cool
the area, isolate our forces from the fire area by closing a door or some other means if possible,
or retreat to an area of safety.
SMOKE EXPLOSION
A smoke explosion can occur either inside or outside the fire compartment when an
accumulation of fuel-rich smoke mixes with additional air and falls within its
flammable/explosive range. A smoke explosion can occur without warning and occurs without
a sudden change in ventilation.
Smoke Explosion: A rapid fire development that occurs when a smoke-air mixture falls within
its flammable range, either internal or external to the fire compartment, and is ignited in a
manner resulting in a significant pressure front. A smoke explosion occurs without an
immediate ventilation triggering event.
One common example occurs when smoke migrates and accumulates in hidden areas such as
rooms remote from the fire area or void spaces (including cocklofts, attics, or voids within walls).
This smoke then mixes with air to fall within its flammable range and encounters an ignition
source (or is at a temperature above its auto-ignition temperature), resulting in a flame front
propagating through the mixture.
If ignition occurs in a relatively confined space (cockloft, small room, etc.), or if obstacles
promote turbulence, the flame front may accelerate, leading to an over pressure situation that
may result in structural damage and/or injury or death of nearby firefighters.
BACKDRAFT
Backdrafts are caused when there is an introduction of oxygen to a compartment that has been
pressurized by the smoke and fire gases of an oxygen-deficient fire in the Decay Stage. Similar
to smoke explosions, backdrafts are accompanied by a significant over-pressure.
Backdraft: A deflagration resulting from the sudden introduction of air into a confined space
containing oxygen-deficient products of incomplete combustion.
FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 24 of 29

During a backdraft, the ignition pushes unburned fuel-rich gases ahead of the burning smoke-air
mixture as it expands. A large fire ball results as the burning flammable and smoke-air mixture
is forced, under pressure, from the compartment. The over-pressurization and dramatic fireballs
produced during backdraft can result in damage to the structure and extension of the fire
beyond the compartment, and pose several risks to firefighters who are in its path.
A backdraft may lead to a heavy fire condition or may expel all of the fire gases, leaving only
localized combustion in its path.
Backdraft Indicators
No visible/active flaming within the compartment and extremely limited or no ventilation of the
fire compartment
Sometimes but not always in conjunction with the following:
Pulsating smoke, usually pulsating in an in-and-out movement, giving the impression the
“compartment is breathing.” Grey-Yellow smoke seeping out from around closed and intact
doors and windows. Doors and windows usually very hot and window glass discolored and/or
cracked from the heat.
Note: It is important to note that while some or all of these indicators may be present to
indicate the possibility of a backdraft, it is possible for a backdraft to occur without
indications that the fire is in the decay stage being visible from the exterior of the
compartment.
Note: Distinguishing between Smoke Ignitions
A. Backdrafts and Smoke Explosions will be considered the same; except that Backdrafts will
occur immediately following ventilation of the affected compartment.
B. An event will be considered a Smoke Explosion if it occurred without immediate and
direct ventilation of the affected area.
FLASH FIRE (PROPAGATING FLAME FRONTS)
Flash fires involve a flame moving through a flammable mixture with considerable speed,
without developing a significant over-pressure.
Flash Fire: A fire that spreads by means of a flame front rapidly through a diffuse fuel, such as
dust, gas or the vapors of an ignitable liquid, without the production of damaging pressure.
Flash fires can happen within a fire compartment (such as during overhaul) when embers or
sparks can act as an ignition source or external to the compartment in any remote location

FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 25 of 29

where a flammable mixture has collected. Flash fires usually self-extinguish, although
sometimes may ignite secondary fires.
Examples of Flash Fires include ignition of dust in a wood shop, vapors from a roach bomb or
vapors from a newly stained wood floor.
Note: Flash fires which occur in a confined space can cause an over pressure condition and
result in an explosion. This condition would be referred to as an explosion. (e.g., dust
explosion).
BOILING LIQUID EXPANDING VAPOR EXPLOSION (BLEVE)
A BLEVE is an explosion caused by the rupture of a vessel containing a pressurized liquid that
has reached temperatures above its boiling point.
Characteristics of the stored liquid, as well as the storage container, are important in
determining whether there is potential for a BLEVE to occur. When a liquid is heated above its
boiling temperature, it will vaporize, causing an increase in pressure in the container. If the
boiling liquid is in a sealed, rigid container, the pressure in the container will increase as more
liquid boils. If the container is vented, the extra pressure will be released to equalize the
pressure inside the container with that outside the container (atmosphere). If the container is
not vented, or if the relief vent cannot release the building pressure fast enough, the pressure
inside the storage container will increase.
A BLEVE occurs when (1) the liquid in a pressurized vessel is at or heated to a temperature that
exceeds it boiling point and (2) the container ruptures, either due to excessive build-up in
pressure, or due to tank failure caused by mechanical or thermal damage.
When the rupture is catastrophic, the contents of the vessel will boil almost immediately on
release, causing a rapidly expanding vapor cloud. Depending on the temperature, pressure and
type of liquid involved, this expansion may be so rapid that it is classified as an explosion and
can cause significant damage to its surroundings. If the liquid involved is flammable, the
expanding vapor cloud may also be flammable and ignite creating a fire.
BOILOVER
An event in the burning of certain combustible liquids in an open-top tank when, after a long
period of quiescent burning, there is a sudden increase in fire intensity associated with the
expulsion of burning oil from the tank (NFPA).
When water is added to the fuel, it sinks to the bottom of the container and has little effect on
extinguishing the flames which are on the surface of the fuel. Under certain conditions, the
water vaporizes into steam causing it to expand more than 1700 times in volume. The rapidly
FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 26 of 29

expanding steam expels the fuel upward and out of the container, which ignites and results in a
large plume of burning liquid outside of the container.
Boilover commonly occurs in residential kitchen fires when water is added to a grease/oil fire in
an attempt to extinguish the fire. Boilover can be more catastrophic when occurring in a larger
flammable liquid fire such as a transformer fire or tanker truck fire. In most cases, water (without
a suppression additive) has little extinguishing effect on flaming liquid fires.
STACK EFFECT
“Stack Effect” is a term used to describe the movement of air throughout a building that occurs
when the temperature of the interior of a building is different than the temperature of the
external environment. Stack Effect occurs in buildings of all sizes including private dwellings;
although in hi-rise buildings it is significantly more prominent.
Stack Effect encompasses two distinct dynamics; it affects internal vertical air movement inside
the building (up and down the shafts), as well as horizontal air movement (into or out of a floor
within the building). Horizontal air movement occurs as air is exchanged between the building’s
interior and the external environment (in and out windows) or is exchanged within the building
from a given floor into or out of a vertical shaft.
Impact of the Stack Effect
The Stack Effect impacts air movement in a building in two distinct ways:
A. It impacts the vertical direction and magnitude of air movement inside the building itself.
Air inside the building can either move up or down the vertical shafts. This movement
will affect the movement of smoke throughout the building.
B. It impacts the horizontal direction and magnitude of air being exchanged between (1) the
interior of the building and the external environment and (2) the horizontal air movement
on each individual floor to and from the vertical shafts. Air can either be pulled into the
building through available openings (windows, doors), or it can be pushed out of the
building. Likewise, air can be pulled into a particular floor from a vertical shaft or pushed
out of a particular floor into the shaft. This horizontal movement can affect fire and/or
smoke conditions depending on the direction of air movement.
Stack Effect Neutral Pressure Zone
Near the center of the building there will exist an area that experiences no horizontal air
exchange at all (air will not be pulled into or pushed out of an opening or pulled into or pushed
out of a floor due to stack effect). This area is called the “Stack Effect Neutral Pressure Zone”.
The magnitude of horizontal air movement at other parts of the building depends on the
distance from this central point; the further the opening is from the middle floor of the building,

FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 27 of 29

the stronger the Stack Effect will be. This means that lateral air movement will be strongest at
openings (windows) or locations on the uppermost and bottommost floors.
This condition can cause smoke and fire gasses to bypass several floors near the center of the
building (near the stack effect neutral pressure zone), only to be pulled into floors somewhere
above or below the center of the building depending on the direction of the stack effect.
Magnitude of the Stack Effect
The magnitude of the Stack Effect will be dictated by the size of the temperature differential
between the interior of the building and the exterior environment and the height of the building.
A. Stack Effect will be more prominent in extreme weather, when air conditioning or heating
systems make the temperature inside the building remarkably different from the outside
temperature.
B. Taller buildings will experience a more powerful Stack Effect because more air will be
moving over a longer distance inside the building. Also, the presence of large vertical
shafts (stairways, elevators, compactors, etc.) will contribute to the strength of the Stack
Effect.
Direction of the Stack Effect
The direction of the Stack effect will be dictated by whether the interior of the building is warmer
or cooler than the external environment. There is a critical difference, as the air will move in
opposite directions depending on this factor and will have the opposite impact on smoke
movement and fire conditions in different parts of the building.
A. Positive Stack Effect (Winter) is when the interior of a building is warmer than the
external environment.
B. Negative Stack Effect (Summer) is when the interior of a building is cooler than the
external environment.

FIRE BEHAVIOR GLOSSARY & REFERENCE
Page 28 of 29

Two Different Situations:

Positive Stack Effect (Winter) vs. Negative Stack Effect (Summer)
Positive Stack Effect (Winter)
A. In cold weather, air inside occupied buildings is warmer than the air outside the building
due to internal heating systems.
B. As a result, air and smoke movement inside the building will travel upwards via vertical
shafts and attempt to exit the building via available openings near the top of the building.
At the bottom of the shaft, a negative pressure will be generated, which will have the
effect of pulling air into the shaft via available openings near the bottom of the building.
C. A fire on an upper floor will tend to want to vent out of the windows.
D. A fire on a lower floor will tend to draw air into the windows creating conditions similar
to a wind impacted fire.
E. Smoke from a lower floor fire will be drawn up vertical shafts within the building and
pulled back into floors with greater force as you go higher in the building and further
away from the stack effect neutral pressure zone.
Negative Stack Effect (Summer)
A. In hot weather, air inside occupied buildings is cooler than the air outside the building
due to internal air conditioning systems.
B. As a result, air inside the building will travel downwards via vertical shafts and attempt to
exit the building via available openings near the bottom of the building. At the top of the
shaft, a negative pressure will be generated, which will have the effect of pulling air into
the shaft via available openings near the top of the building.
C. This is also known as “Reverse Stack Effect.”
D. A fire on an upper floor will tend to draw air into the windows creating conditions similar
to a wind impacted fire.
E. A fire on a lower floor will tend to want to vent out of the windows
F. Smoke from an upper floor fire will be drawn toward the vertical shafts within the
building and will typically travel downward. It can be pulled back into floors with greater
force as you go lower in the building and further below the stack effect neutral pressure
zone.

PURPOSE
The objective of the Emergency Operations Plan is to mobilize the resources of the entire
Phoenix Fire Department to an elevated level when circumstances require a commitment
beyond normal capabilities. The activation of this plan will cause the Fire Department Tactical
Operations Center (TOC) to go into operation. Identified Command Officers will respond to that
location. The general categories of situations that would cause the activation of the TOC:
• One major incident affecting a localized or widespread area.
• Two or more working incidents causing a high demand for resources at different
locations.
• Numerous simultaneous incidents causing a peak demand on the entire system.
• When determined necessary by the Fire Chief or Executive Staff.
The purpose of the TOC will be to bring appropriate Command Officers and other staff together
at a central location and to:
• Analyze the emergency situation.
• Determine what Fire Department and other City resources are needed for the
emergency.
• Place additional apparatus in service as deemed necessary.
• Recall appropriate personnel resources as necessary.
• Make Fire Department policy regarding the department’s response and management of
the emergency.
• Prioritize response and resources as necessary (see Emergency Deployment, M.P.
201.02A)
• Select and provide personnel to staff the City's Emergency Operations Center if opened.
Each Division of the Fire Department is assigned specific roles and responsibilities in order to
support emergency operations. It is the responsibility of each Division and Section to be
prepared to function according to these guidelines whenever the need is identified.
TOC IMMEDIATE TASKS AND DECISIONS
Command Staff reporting to the TOC will be responsible for the following decisions and tasks:
• Confirm that Emergency Response Staffing Office (ERSO) is manned and prepared to
initiate recall, if needed.
• Determine the need for and initiate additional staffing of the Alarm Room.
• Confirm an TOC liaison is established and functioning at the Incident Command Post(s).
• Determine the need for a TOC Liaison at the Alarm Room (preferably the Alarm Room
Chief).
• Confirm that resource management has been opened to address any identified logistical
needs. This may include preparation of reserve apparatus and deployment of
specialized equipment.

EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT

M.P. 201.02A

03/2021-R

Page 1 of 3

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide guidelines for the operational response to situations
which create peak demand for emergency services within the Automatic Aid System.
Emergency Deployment is intended to significantly increase the number of available emergency
response resources.
PROCEDURE FOR EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT ACTIVATION AND DEACTIVATION
1. Emergency Deployment will be activated at the direction of the on-duty Operations
Deputy Chief (i.e., Shift Commander, District Commander, etc.) in conjunction with
Alarm Room Headquarters (AHQ) when it is evident that deployment activity may
exceed system wide available resource guidelines and/or high activity levels warrant.
a. Emergency Deployment may be activated for an individual jurisdiction, multiple
jurisdictions or system wide within the Automatic Aid System.
2. Emergency Deployment will be de-activated at the direction of the Operations Deputy
Chief in conjunction with AHQ. All modified response requirements will return to normal
operating guidelines.
There are three (3) types of Emergency Deployment. The Operations Deputy Chief will
determine the appropriate type of Emergency Deployment and communicate this to AHQ.
TYPE 1 EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT
Activation of a Type 1 Emergency Deployment will automatically modify response requirements
for all non-EMS incidents through the following deployment directives:
1. All 3-1 response assignments will be modified to 2-1-1 (ENG/LAD/BC) response
assignments.
2. All First Alarm response assignments will be modified to 3-1-1 (ENG/LAD/BC) response
assignments.
3. All TRT2 response assignments will be modified to TRT1 response assignments.
4. All HAZ2 response assignment will be modified to HAZ1 response assignments.
5. All TRT1 and HAZ1 response assignment will be modified to a new TRT0 and HAZ0
response assignment. These assignments include MPW, closest appropriate Special
Operations crew (either TRT or HMT), the applicable Support Truck and either C957N
or C957S. If C957N and C957S are unavailable BC2 or other appropriate BC will be
suggested.
TYPE 2 EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT
Activation of a Type 2 Emergency Deployment will require the on-duty Operations Deputy Chief
to call off-duty personnel in to staff brush trucks or other adjunct response apparatus.
Coordination between the Assistant Chief of Operations, the on-duty Operations Deputy Chief,
on-duty AHQ Chief and/or Supervisor and the CAD Administrator/Technical Services Chief will

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT

M.P. 201.02A

03/2021-R

Page 2 of 3

be necessary to determine the appropriate staffing levels, response guidelines, equipment
needs and applicable CAD programming. A Type 2 Emergency Deployment will be developed
on a case by case basis and may be used for but not limited to Fire, EMS and HAZMAT
situations.
Type 2 Emergency Deployment can be activated to address any specific operational issue
including pandemic response and in instances where a specific call type is back logging the
system due to a high volume of calls or inadequate number of response equipment available in
the system. In these cases, case specific or lower priority calls may be assigned to these units
and dispatched based on their availability.
CAD programming and the immediate updating of response guidelines to AHQ will be required
prior to implementing a Type 2 Emergency Deployment. Emergency Deployment will be deactivated at the direction of the Operations Deputy Chief in conjunction with AHQ. Brush truck
capabilities will return to normal and will be placed in an UNV status if not assigned to a call. If
other adjunct response apparatus is utilized the capabilities will return to normal and will be
placed in the appropriate normal operating status.
TYPE 3 EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT
Activation of a Type 3 Emergency Deployment will require the on-duty Operations Deputy Chief
or designee to call off-duty personnel in to staff reserve apparatus. This will be a manual
process and require coordination between the on-duty Deputy Chief or designee, Fleet
Management and the AHQ as units are made available. Emergency Deployment will be deactivated at the direction of the on-duty Operations Deputy Chief in conjunction with the AHQ.
All reserve apparatus will place themselves in an UNV status if not assigned to a call.
SYSTEMWIDE REDUCTION IN WORKFORCE
Automatic Aid System is committed to making system-wide coverage decisions in the best
interest of all customers and firefighter safety. The system is obligated to prepare for a potential
reduction in available workforce. Reduction in workforce may have a substantial impact causing
a staffing failure within the system. To prevent a staffing failure, all partners must have an
emergency staffing and/or mandatory overtime policy. If local emergency staffing policies fail,
sworn staff shall be redeployed from support functions to keep emergency response resources
in service. If the steps above fail to provide necessary staffing, in-service emergency response
resources will be redeployed to address immediate coverage gaps. This process will be
administered by the Phoenix and Mesa Regional Dispatch Centers using a parallel
methodology to a move-up assignment or system-wide emergency redeployment.
Regional Fire Departments may then recall available off-duty personnel to staff system-wide
emergency response resources to 100% capacity. To support this, Automatic Aid Partners may
utilize the Arizona Mutual Aid Compact for municipal reimbursement.

OPERATIONAL INFORMATION
System wide available resource guidelines:
1. Any one (1) large scale incident may use sixty percent (60%) of Automatic Aid
resources. Forty percent (40%) of Automatic Aid resources must remain in service to
handle routine emergency activity within the system.
2. If two (2) large scale incidents are working simultaneously, each incident may use thirtyfive percent (35%) of Automatic Aid resources. Thirty percent (30%) of Automatic Aid
resources must remain in service to handle routine emergency activity within the
system.
3. If three (3) large scale incidents are working simultaneously, each incident may use
twenty-five percent (25%) of Automatic Aid resources. Twenty-five percent (25%) of
Automatic Aid resources must remain in service to handle routine emergency activity
within the system.
It will be the responsibility of AHQ to coordinate the efficient movement of resources.
EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT PRINCIPLES
1. Emergency Deployment has been automated in CAD and can be initiated as an
independent activation type, or as concurrent activation types, as necessary to mitigate
the incident or situation.
2. Activation of each Type of Emergency Deployment will activate a system wide
Qpage/phone page so that all jurisdictions within the Automatic Aid System are aware of
high activity levels and potential impact to individual jurisdictions.
3. Activation of each Type of Emergency Deployment will generate a MCT message so
that all jurisdictions within the Automatic Aid System are aware of high activity levels and
potential impact to individual jurisdictions.
4. Activation of each Type of Emergency Deployment will prompt AHQ to open all station
packages with a voice announcement advising of Emergency Deployment mode so that
all jurisdictions within the Automatic Aid System are aware of high activity levels and
potential impact to individual jurisdictions.
5. AHQ has the ability to over-ride a modified response at dispatch, if applicable based on
information received.
6. Responding units or a unit on-scene has the ability to balance a modified response to a
full assignment if necessary.
7. Emergency Deployment can be implemented for a single jurisdiction, multiple
jurisdictions or system wide.

Emergency Power Outage Plan
M.P. 201.02B

11/14-R

12/19-SR

The purpose of this plan is to describe Deployment Services and Fire Operations actions that will be followed
during extended power outages with extreme (heat or cold) weather conditions. The aim of this plan is to
check and secure the welfare of those customers in the outage area that may be at high risk due to age,
health/impairments, or immobility’s. The well-being of citizens in this group could be compromised or
challenged, having to go without electrical service, heating, and cooling for extended periods of time.
In a reported electrical power outage area, a power company "trouble shooter" or repair crew must arrive at
the location of the power outage to survey the damage before an estimated time of repair can be made. Once
the estimated time of repair is determined, this information is relayed to the power company operation center.
The supervisor in each center should be the contact point for Deployment Services. Deployment Services has
direct ring-down lines to both APS and SRP operation centers.
PROCEDURE
The Emergency Power Outage Plan can be implemented when the heat stress factor (temperature and
humidity) exceeds 105 or extremely cold temperatures below 34 degrees. This activation may be initiated at the
discretion of:
1. North Shift Commander or South Shift Commander
2. Deployment Battalion Chief or Deployment Supervisor
3. Any Executive Staff Chief Officer or Command Officer
The objective of the Emergency Power Outage Plan is to provide basic guidelines for operational response to
assist citizens during extended power outages. The specific focus of this procedure is to address the immediate
and perhaps long-term needs of high-risk groups such as the elderly, shut-in, and/or infirm during extreme
weather conditions.
Upon notification of a significant power outage, the Deployment Battalion Chief Officer or Deployment
Supervisor will work in conjunction with the North Shift Commander and South Shift Commander to implement
the Emergency Power Outage procedure.
The Shift Commanders should notify on-duty Battalion Chiefs of the implementation of the Emergency Power
Outage Plan (All-call).
The Battalion Chief of the affected area should be dispatched to meet with the power company “customer
service representative” to establish a partnership to determine and coordinate resource and specific need
requirements of that area; (i.e., evacuations/location, Red Cross, door-to-door check welfare, neighborhood
activation, transportation, hospitals, loss control, ice, heating, rehab, PIO, and Occupant Services and CR vans) if
necessary a Command Team may be activated.

11/14-R

12/19-SR

The Shift Commanders and Deployment Battalion Chief Officer will assist in coordinating communications
between fire, power company operations, and other agencies.
Weather often times is a major factor in power outages, so it is likely that the Emergency Power Outage Plan
will have to be implemented in concert with components of the Emergency Operations Plan and procedures for
severe storm.
If evacuation is required, the Evacuation Plans M.P. identifies the method and resources required to execute a
small to large-scale evacuation.
When a large-scale power outage creates a high demand for fire department resources and services, and those
circumstances require a commitment beyond normal capabilities, the Emergency Operations Plan should be
considered.
A system-wide outage is not plausible; a large outage would be managed by utilizing Command Procedures.
OPERATIONAL INFORMATION
The power companies generally experience three types of power outages:
LOCAL OUTAGES
FEEDER OUTAGES
ROLLING BLACKOUTS

Such as wires or poles down, pole fires or transformer problems which usually
will affect a local area.
Such as damage or problems at one of their substations or major distribution
lines. Feeder outages will normally cause a larger area to be without power.
As a last resort power companies will discontinue electricity to circuits to
reduce power consumption and allow the company time to reroute power to
compensate for the outage. This should only last 20 – 30 minutes.

These terms are relative to the perspective of each power company, for instance, LOCAL--when a transformer
goes out in an area served by SRP, it will usually cut service to approximately 10 residences. Whereas an area
served by APS, one transformer outage could affect approximately 35 residences or in some locations could
affect as many as 800 homes. FEEDER--a major line or circuit outage in a SRP area would cut services to
approximately 200 customers (residences/commercial). Whereas the same outage in an APS area could affect
2,000 (two thousand) of their customers. A rolling blackout can occur when demand for electricity exceeds
supply and this usually affects a large geographic area. A rolling blackout can be compared to a large
thunderstorm moving across the Valley, resulting in power outages behind the front.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Emergency Power Outage Plan
M.P. 201.02B

11/14-R

12/19-SR

Time without power will be a major determining factor in any plans developed or actions taken.
The power company can provide a good description as to the size, type of occupancies, location, and number of
customers in the areas without power. Most rolling blackouts will last 20 to 30 minutes and may not require
evacuations.
Both power companies will assign "customer service reps" who will respond to the outage areas to assist with
questions and in some cases providing hot or cold drinks and ice to the customer.
Consideration should be given to the following:
1. Duration of the outage (greater than three hours consider evacuation, less than three hours shelter inplace)
2. PIO and media notifications
3. Firefighter call back
4. City coverage
5. Shelters
6. Use of City buses
7. Red Cross
8. Liaison(s) (SRP, APS, etc.)
9. Emergency Operations Center
10. City Official Notifications

ACCOUNTABILITY
M.P. 201.03

01/21-R

Page 1 of 6

PURPOSE
This procedure identifies the accountability system. It is the responsibility of all members operating at
an emergency incident to actively participate in the accountability system. It is the responsibility of the
Incident Commander to maintain an awareness of the location and function of all companies or crews
when operating on any emergency incident. Sector Officers and Company Officers assigned the
responsibility of a specific function or tactical area will account for those personnel working in their area
of responsibility. In addition, this procedure identifies those actions that are specific to accountability on
the fireground or other hazardzone operations. Generally speaking, the accountability responsibilities
and actions within this procedure apply to any area that requires the use of an SCBA. The
accountability system has proven to increase firefighter safety and provide the Incident Command
Team, Sector Officer/Division/Group Supervisor, and Company Officers a means to track the location
and function of firefighters on the scene.
ACCOUNTABILITY RESPONSIBILITIES
Accountability is a critical element in maintaining the safety of all firefighters working on the fireground.
Each person involved in an incident whether at the strategic, tactical, or task level of an incident must
make a strong personal commitment to follow all policies and procedures regarding accountability.
Command/Strategic Level:
• Addresses the strategic level of accountability by the tracking of all crews and
sectors/divisions/groups by location and function on a tactical worksheet.
• Command must know who is in charge of each sector/division/group, crews assigned to each
sector/division/group, where each sector/division/group is located, and what each
sector/division/group is assigned to do.
• Command will include accountability as a major element in strategy and attack planning and
must consider and react to any barriers to effective accountability.
• Command will consider air supply when making tactical assignments including rotation of crews.
• Command
must
obtain

(PAR)
from
Sector
Officers/Division/Group Supervisors and crews.
Sector Officer/Division/Group Supervisor/Tactical Level:
• Addresses the tactical level of accountability by tracking of crews assigned to their sector.
• Sector Officers/Division/Group Supervisors must know the location and function of assigned
crews.
• Sector Officers/Division/Group Supervisors must be in his/her assigned area to maintain close
supervision of assigned crews.
• Sector Officers/Division/Group Supervisors must obtain PARs of all crewmembers of all
companies assigned to his/her sector/division/group.

Company Officer/Task Level:

Address the task level of accountability and must know where each firefighter is located and
what each firefighter is doing.
Company Officers shall maintain a current PASSPORT of personnel responding on the
apparatus at all times.
Company Officers shall maintain a current MCT roster of personnel responding on the
apparatus at all times. This includes MCT roster alignment with the members assigned radio.
Company Officers must ensure that all crewmembers have proper helmet company ID and
nametags on helmet.
Company Officers must obtain PARs for their crews, which is a confirmation that all members
assigned to his/her crew are accounted for and have an adequate exit air supply.
Company Officers must keep crew intact and maintain an awareness of the crews exit air
supply.
Company Officers must ensure that passport is delivered to their accountability location prior to
entering the hot zone and retrieved upon exiting the hot zone.

Engineer:
• Accountability officer who tracks crews and crewmembers who take handlines from his/her
apparatus.
• Collects passports from crews prior to entering the hot zone
• Places passport/pouch on discharge gate when hoseline is charged. If no passport is available,
engineer should note crew id on pump panel with grease pencil at discharge gate.
• Places hoseline ID tags on each hoseline.
Firefighter:
• Must have proper company ID on his/her helmet.
• Ensure that nametag is placed on passport and roster is updated.
• Stay with his/her crew at all times.
• Maintain a constant awareness of his/her exit air supply.
All Members:
• Immediately update the company passport as they arrive for duty.
• Ensure that helmet IDs are accurate.
• Ensure that nametags are on helmet.
• Ensure that SCBA identification markings are in place.
• All crews work within the incident command system, no free lancing.
• Crews arriving on the scene should remain intact. A minimum crew size will be considered two
or more members.
• Each member must have a radio.
• All crews entering the hot zone must have a supervisor.
• All crews will go in together, stay together, and come out together.
• Reduced visibility and increased risk will require close supervision by the Company Officer.

The entire crew will exit if a SCBA, radio, or any equipment that could compromise safety fails
while in the hot zone.

ACCOUNTABILITY EQUIPMENT
The passport system will be used to effectively track firefighters in the hot zone. Accountability
equipment for each piece of apparatus and shift consists of a passport with a pouch, small company id
tag, helmet ID stickers, and hose ID tag. Passports are bright yellow tags, which measure
approximately 3 by 4 inches that are marked with company identification and shift. Nametags of
crewmembers assigned to each apparatus are affixed to the passport, which is placed in the passport
pouch. The small company id tag is kept in a pocket on the back of the passport pouch and is used to
replace the passport at the pump panel in the event that accountability is tracked closer to the building
by a sector/division/group. The passport, passport pouch, and company hoseline id tag are kept
together as a unit on the apparatus dash at the Company Officer position or passenger side. A Velcro
strip will allow the passport/pouch to be affixed to the dash and easily removed.
Each firefighter is issued individual nametags. One nametag for each member presently assigned to
the company is required to be placed on the passport. Extra individual nametags should be kept on the
underside of their helmet.
Firefighter helmets shall always reflect the ID of the company the firefighter is presently assigned. All
personnel, including rovers and constant staffers are required to keep their helmet IDs accurate. Extra
helmet ID stickers are kept with the passport in the passport pouch. Nametags shall be affixed to
firefighter helmets.
ACCOUNTABILITY HARDWARE USE
Each Company Officer will be responsible for ensuring that the passport and MCT roster reflects only
the members presently assigned to the company. Passports shall reflect only those crewmembers
about to enter the hot zone. When entering the hot zone with a partial crew, such as when an engineer
remains at the engine to pump lines, the Company Officer must remove the nametags of those
members not entering the hot zone. The nametags of these members may be returned to the member,
placed on the Company Officer's helmet Velcro strip or placed in his/her coat pocket.
Implementation of the passport system will occur at any incident that requires the use of an SCBA. The
use of the accountability system will commence as the first unit arrives on the scene. The first arriving
company will give an on-scene report by radio and assume command. In the follow up report, their
accountability unit identification and geographic location, north, south, east, or west will be announced.
As staged units are assigned, Command will give assignments, which will include their respective
accountability unit identification and geographic location. Each crew will deliver their passport to the
engineer of the engine where they deployed a handline.
When the engineer charges the stretched hoseline with water, their unit’s passport, passport pouch,
and hoseline ID tag are placed on the discharge gate at the pump panel. In the event a passport is not

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

ACCOUNTABILITY
M.P. 201.03

01/21-R

Page 4 of 6

available, the engineer will use a grease pencil or other material to mark the pump panel. The
passports on the discharge gates identify crews and crew members on each hoseline, allow engineers
to identify hoselines to change pump pressure, and makes the pump panel an accountability station for
the engineer to track crews. Hoseline ID tags are removed from the passport at the discharge gate and
placed on each respective hoseline by the engineer. These hoseline ID tags provide a means to identify
hoselines that crews entered the building on and are a reference point to find lost or trapped
firefighters. As additional companies arrive, their passports/pouches are delivered to the engineer of
apparatus that the crew took the handline off. The engineer becomes the accountability officer for those
crews that took hoselines from his/her apparatus.
Ladder crews will leave their passport on the apparatus dash when going to the roof to perform
ventilation. When going to the interior of the structure, each ladder crew will deliver their passport to the
engine closest to their point of entry.
Once a passport is delivered to the pump operator, the passport will remain on the designated
discharge gate indicating the "point of entry" to the hot zone. Upon exit, the Company Officer must
retrieve their passport. Both the Company Officer and accountability officer will be responsible to see
the passports are retrieved. Crews exiting at a different location other than the original point of entry
must immediately notify their original Sector Officer Division/Group Supervisor and/or Accountability
Officer of their changed status. The passport must be retrieved.
BACK UP ACCOUNTABILITY KIT
A backup accountability kit has been issued to each engine to provide a means to maintain
accountability in the event that a crew arrives at an accountability location without their accountability
equipment. Each back up kit is kept in a blue nylon bag that contains the following equipment:
• Three blank hoseline id tags – to mark company ID with grease pencil
• One passport pouch
• One blank passport – to mark crew member IDs with grease pencil
• One blank passport with Velcro – to attach crew member nametags from underside of helmet
• One grease pencil
Command Officers should carry a backup accountability pack to maintain and track accountability when
assigned to a forward position. The backup accountability pack should contain the following
equipment:
• Two blank passports with Velcro – to mark with grease pencil
• One wrist mounted accountability board with Velcro
• Three hoseline tags – to mark company ID with grease pencil
• Two grease pencils

Page 5 of 6

As Battalion Chiefs are assigned to manage sectors/divisions/groups, the FIT will assume safety
sector/division/group responsibilities for that sector/division/group, which includes accountability. At
these incidents and at incidents involving a lost or trapped firefighter, “May Day” situations,
accountability may be managed by a Battalion Chief and FIT in a sector/division/group closer to the
building. The Battalion Chief and FIT would collect the passports/pouches from the initial engine
accountability locations. The small company ID tag is removed from the back of the passport pouch and
replaces the passport/pouch on the discharge gate at the pump panel. Accountability is now
established and tracked closer to the building using their accountability pack.
TERMINATING THE PASSPORT SYSTEM
Passport accountability will be maintained throughout the entire incident. Accountability can be
terminated following a report of "fire under control," at which time a PAR for all crews must be obtained.
Based on a risk management assessment of the scene, Command will determine whether to continue
or terminate the use of the passport system. If visibility remains impaired or if a significant hazard
exists, Command may choose to extend the use of the passport system further. Upon termination and
release from the incident, Company Officers and crewmembers will ensure that the passport/pouch is
accurate and returned to the dash of their apparatus.
PASSPORT RULES
• Passports will reflect only those personnel presently in the hot zone.
• Passports will be delivered to the assigned accountability location prior to entering the hot zone.
• Passports will be maintained at the point of entry to the hot zone.
• Passports never enter the hot zone.
• Passports will be retrieved upon exiting the hot zone.
• Passport accountability location is the engine where the crew deployed hoseline.
PERSONNEL ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT (PAR)
The Personnel Accountability Report (PAR) involves a roll call of all personnel assigned to crews and
sectors/divisions/groups that are working in the hot zone. The PAR is a confirmation that all members
are accounted for and have an adequate exit air supply. For the Sector Officer/Division/Group
Supervisor, a "PAR" is an accounting for all crewmembers of all companies assigned to his/her
sector/division/group. For the Company Officer, a PAR is an accounting of all crewmembers assigned
to his/her company. Reports of PAR's should be conducted face-to-face within the sector/division/group
or company whenever possible.
A personnel accountability report will be required for the following situations:
• Any report of a missing or trapped fire fighter
• Any change from offensive to defensive
• Any sudden hazardous event at the incident - flash over, back draft, collapse, May Day, etc.
• As companies report an all clear
• As companies report under control
• At every 30 minutes of elapsed time

The use of an accountability system will commence as the first unit arrives on the scene. The unit
containing the passport / pouch and hose ID tag will be removed from the apparatus dash. All crews
reporting to the building will deliver their passports to the building lobby. The hoseline ID tag will be
taken by each crew to mark their hose line in the stairwell at the standpipe. Lobby
Sector/Division/Group will utilize the passports to track all crews and crewmembers in the building.
Crews will leave their passports with fire personnel in the fire control room with Building Systems if
Lobby/Sector Officer/Division/Group has not been established. The lobby sector/division/group will be
responsible for collecting the passports of the initial companies as soon as possible once it is

2 In / 2 Out
M.P. 201.04

01/14-R

Page 1 of 2

Purpose
The purpose of the this procedure is to define the considerations for meeting the 2 in / 2 out procedure
requirement based on OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134(g)(4). This procedure is meant as the standard application for the
Phoenix Regional Dispatch System for the OSHA standard to meet all requirements and at the same time provide
for all tactical needs in the hazard zone.
Objective
OSHA states that “once fire fighters begin the interior attack on an interior structural fire, the atmosphere is
assumed to be IDLH and paragraph 29 CFR 1910.134(g)(4) [two-in/two-out] applies.”
The objective of 2 in / 2 out is to have fully equipped firefighters in position during the initial fire attack to react in
the event of a Mayday situation.
The 2 in / 2 out procedure will be established anytime firefighters are on air inside a structure and no other units
have arrived onscene. In the event the initial company arrives onscene of a fire in the incipient stages the 2 in / 2
out procedure is not required. OSHA further defines an incipient stage fire in 29 CFR 1910.155(c)(26) as a “fire
which is in the initial or beginning stage and which can be controlled or extinguished by portable fire
extinguishers, Class II standpipe or small hose systems without the need for protective clothing or breathing
apparatus.”

Standard Exceptions to the 2 in / 2 out Requirement at Structure Fires
1. When there is a reported or suspected life hazard where immediate action could prevent the loss of life.
2. When the fire is in an incipient stage as defined above.
During the initial deployment of the first in company, the only radio communications with regards to 2 in / 2 out
that are necessary is when the 2 in / 2 out standard is not met. The only acceptable reasons for not meeting the 2
in / 2 out standard would be as defined above. Also, the 2 in / 2 out standard is met when the second arriving fire
company arrives and is positioned onscene or in Level 1 staging.
When the standard is met, it is critical that the accountability for the 2 in / 2 out team members is managed by the
Incident Commander whether they are in the fast attack or stationary command mode. It is the requirement that
the Incident Commander (initial arriving Company Officer) account for the individual members of the 2 in / 2 out
team. It is also the requirement for the individual 2 in / 2 out team members make the Incident Commander
aware of their position and function for accountability.

Operational 2 in / 2 out
 Temporary two-person tactical reserve assigned at the outset of an incident to allow teams to enter an
IDLH, or potential IDLH atmosphere.
One primary member of the 2 in / 2 out pair must be solely dedicated to tracking interior personnel. Their
function is to react in a safe and effective manner based on their capabilities and ability to communicate in the
event of a Mayday by firefighters making the initial fire attack. This position requires appropriate PPE, a radio with
the appropriate hazard zone capabilities and to work within the incident management system.
The standards state that the second member of the 2 in / 2 out team may be engaged in other activities within the
hazard zone including Engineers operating the pumper.
If members of the 2 in / 2 out team are required to assist with a Mayday situation, it is imperative that they
communicate their actions with Command or AHQ. 2 in / 2 out members must maintain a level of accountability
to Command even when acting in a Mayday situation.
Standard Implementation of 2 in / 2 out for a Four-Person Crew
The 2 in / 2 out procedure should be used when the initial arriving Company Officer is operating in the fast attack
mode as the Incident Commander on an interior attack with another crew member. The plug person assumes the
primary 2 in / 2 out position and the engineer assumes the secondary 2 in / 2 out position.
It is necessary that any rescue efforts be initiated as a team (2 members) and well communicated prior to action.
Mayday response should always be managed with the Risk Management Plan by the incident commander and
acted upon based on the capabilities of the 2 in / 2 out team.

PURPOSE
The Phoenix Fire Department (PFD) holds the safety of our members as our highest priority. The
purpose of this procedure is to describe the Incident Safety System that assigns the responsibility for
firefighter Safety to an individual beginning with the first arriving Company Officer and the process by
which this responsibility is transferred, expanded, and continued as the incident grows up to and
including termination of Command. Information related to this M.P. may be found in:

OVERVIEW
It is the policy of the Phoenix Fire Department that any member witnessing an unsafe act by another
member that may result in injury or worse to one of our members has the authority and obligation to
intervene and stop the unsafe act. The Incident Safety System is implemented any time the Phoenix
Fire Department responds to an incident. This Procedure describes how an Incident Safety Officer
(ISO) and/or Assistant Incident Safety Officers (AISO) are integrated into our Incident Management
System, automatically, every time we respond to an incident. The language and safety system structure
used in this procedure are intended to conform to NFPA standard 1561, the National Incident
Management System (NIMS), and to embody the intent of NFPA 1521.
Fire departments in the Phoenix Regional Automatic Aid Consortium (the consortium) manage safety
using two different but interoperable systems; the single dedicated Incident Safety Officer (ISO), and
the Incident Safety Officer System (ISOS). It is the intent of this procedure to describe both systems,
outline roles and responsibilities of key safety positions, and to explain the interoperability of the
systems. While these two different systems exist for smaller scale incidents within the region, when
incidents escalate to greater alarms and command van operations are initiated there exists only one
formalized safety system. This is also described in this procedure.
This procedure in no way diminishes the responsibility of each and every member to safe work
behaviors and to operate within standard operating procedures at all times. Company officers carry an
additional responsibility of ensuring that all members of their crew are operating in a safe manner.
Chief Officers and sector officers must also insure that operations are conducted safely.
DEFINITIONS
This section briefly describes the positions listed below. Further details and duties for positions are
included in the body of this procedure.
Incident: An incident is described as “any emergency situation that threatens life, safety, or property”.
Timely response and effective management of EMS, rescue, hazardous material release and fire
control situations represent the most immediate priorities of the fire department.

Incident Commander (IC): This refers to the position within the Incident Command System (ICS) that
is in charge of incident management. The IC has overall responsibility for the safety of responders
working at an emergency scene. That responsibility cannot be delegated. The SOFR/ISO assists the IC
and acts as the IC's eyes and ears on matters related to safety, and has the authority to manage safety
as described further in this procedure.
Support Officer: A position within ICS that supports the IC. This position functions as the Incident
Safety Officer in the ISOS until command van operations are commenced and a Safety Officer is
assigned.
Sector Officer: This refers to the position within ICS that is assigned to a geographical area or
particular function and manages units assigned to these areas during incidents.
Field Incident Technician (FIT): A company officer assigned to work with a command officer. Often
this position is assigned the Support Officer/ISO or Assistant Incident Safety Officer (AISO) role during
incidents. Some cities in the Automatic Aid Consortium use a Battalion Safety Officer (BSO) to fill this
position.
Safety Officer (SOFR)/ Incident Safety Officer (ISO): A member of the Command Staff responsible
for monitoring and assessing safety hazards or unsafe situations and for developing measures for
ensuring personnel safety.
Assistant Incident Safety Officer (AISO): An individual appointed or assigned at an incident scene by
the Incident Commander (IC) to assist the ISO in the performance of ISO functions.
Initial Rapid Intervention Crew (IRIC): Temporary two-person team assigned at the outset of a
working fire to allow a two-person team to enter the structure to perform primary search and rescue
when information indicates a potential life hazard situation that can be resolved by rapid search and
rescue.
Rapid Intervention Crew (RIC): Four-person crew fully equipped on site, in a ready state, to
immediately react and respond to rescue firefighters.
Incident Safety Plan: Hazard control strategies developed by the ISO to address the incident action
plan and the type of incident encountered.
INCIDENT SAFETY SYSTEM – DEPLOYMENT MODEL
An incident safety system will be implemented every time the Phoenix Fire Department responds to an
incident. The incident safety function begins with the first arriving unit, typically the company officer/IC
as part of the initial size up and continues until the incident is terminated. Safety is integrated in the
strategic decision making process of looking at critical fireground factors present at the incident, and
applying the risk management profile to choose an appropriate strategy and develop an Incident Action
Plan (IAP). This process begins implementation of the incident safety system, and identifies the initial
IC as responsible for the safety function; this IC is the initial IC/ISO. The initial IC/ISO maintains this
responsibility until Command is transferred or the incident is terminated.

Role and responsibility of the initial IC/ISO:
• Follow Phoenix Regional Standard Operating Procedures
• Use the Standard Risk Management Plan
• Analyze critical fire ground factors present at the incident
• Determine a strategy (Offensive or Defensive)
• Establish the Personnel Accountability System
• Provide a standard initial radio report that includes an On-Scene Report and Follow-up
Report as defined in Command Procedures M.P. 201.01 08/10/R
• Establish Initial Rapid Intervention Crew (IRIC)
• Manage incoming resources until incident command is passed to another arriving
company officer or command officer.
• Provide for the ongoing safety of all members involved in the incident
This initial company officer as the IC/ISO provides the beginning of the Incident Safety Officer System
(ISOS) and insures that firefighter safety is a priority upon arrival of the first unit and is maintained
though standard transfer of Command and ISO responsibilities until the incident is stabilized or
Command is terminated.
EMS (one or two units) and Still Assignments
For incidents such as a still assignment or car fire, and one or two company response to an EMS call,
the company officer maintains the role of IC and ISO. The company officer’s safety responsibilities
include:
• Manage task level safety concerns (driving safety, appropriate PPE, equipment use, etc.)
• Size up critical factors and apply the Risk Management Plan at all incidents
• Manage crew accountability through sight, voice, or touch
• Actively monitor air supply of crew
• Monitor crew member fatigue and need to for recycle
• Communication and mitigation of hazards
• Continue monitoring and reevaluating incident hazards and risk /benefit of actions
• Request additional resources and command components as necessary
Those filling the role of IC/ISO must be a capable of filling the role of company officer.
Structure Fire Assignments (3-1’s, First Alarms)
Individual jurisdictions may customize the primary and secondary response requirements on a given
Nature Code. CAD will automatically dispatch the required units per Nature Code entered for each
jurisdiction. The RSPREQ command may be utilized to determine the specific primary and secondary
response requirements per Nature Code for an individual jurisdiction:
Format:
RSPREQ Nature Code. Jurisdiction Code (3 letters)
Example:
RSPREQ STR1A, PHX
The first arriving company officer, following standard Command Procedures will assume Command and
become IC #1. IC #1’s role includes both Command and Incident Safety Officer. When information
indicates a potential life hazard situation exists that can be resolved by a rapid search and rescue by
the first arriving company (four person crew), the IC may establish an IRIC. A Firefighter and Engineer
can fill this role while the IC and the other firefighter conduct a rapid search and rescue. One member
of the IRIC must monitor the tactical radio channel and both members must be prepared to assist the
interior portion of the crew if needed.

The first arriving response command officer (usually a Battalion Chief), following standard transfer of
Command procedures will assume Command and becomes the IC. The FIT assigned to the IC
becomes the support officer and assumes the responsibilities of the Incident Safety Officer. Company
officers continue to manage the task level safety of their crews.
Note: In some departments within the consortium, responding BC’s may not have a FIT. If the first
arriving BC does not have a FIT, and assumes Command, he/she assumes both Command and ISO
responsibilities until a support officer/ISO is assigned.
It is the Responsibility of the IC to perform the Functions of Command to achieve the Tactical
Objectives.
• Assume and announce Command and establish an effective initial command position
(Command Post).
• Rapidly evaluate the situation (size up)
• Initiate, maintain, and control effective incident communications.
• Provide and manage a steady, adequate, and timely stream of appropriate resources.
• Identify the incident strategy, develop an Incident Action Plan (IAP), and assign companies and
personnel consistent with plans and standard operating procedures.
• Develop an effective incident organization using Sectors/Divisions/Groups to decentralize and
delegate geographic and functional responsibility.
• Review, and revise (as needed) the strategy to keep the IAP current.
• Provide for the continuity, transfer, and termination of Command.
Roles and Responsibilities of the Support Officer:
• Define, evaluate, and recommend changes to the incident action plan.
• Provide direction relating to tactical priorities and specific critical fireground factors.
• Become the Incident Safety Officer
• Evaluate the need for additional resources.
• Assign logistics responsibilities.
• Assist with the tactical worksheet for control and accountability.
• Evaluate the fireground organization and span of control.
• Other duties as necessary.
The next arriving BC can be assigned Recon when appropriate or assigned to the most critical
Sector/Division or Group. Note: Sectors Divisions and Groups are addressed in M.P. 201.01 Command
Procedures. For the remainder of this M.P. we will refer to Sectors with the understanding that some
departments will substitute divisions and/or groups where appropriate.
Once assigned to a sector, the BC assumes the responsibilities’ of a Sector Officer as described in
Command procedures. The BC’s FIT becomes the Sector Safety Officer and an AISO for the incident.
Role of the FIT as a Sector Safety Officer (AISO) partnered with a BC
• Perform Sector Safety Officer (AISO) function/role
• Assess and address safety concerns within the sector
• Assist the BC with managing the sector (stay together)
• Manage accountability within the sector (hose tags too)
• Provide air management within the sector
• Manage work/rest cycles within the sector
• Manage the sector’s On-Deck crews recycle and rehab

Establish communications with the ISO (you will call them ‘Command’) once the IC has
assigned a Safety Channel
Coordinate with other Sector Safety Officers (AISOs)

On-Deck Companies
”On Deck” is defined as; a forward staging position located just outside the immediate hazard zone,
safely distanced from the entrance of a tactical position/Sector. On Deck crews will be supervised
either by the Sector Officer or Company Officer and they will remain On Deck until assigned by the IC
or Sector Officer. The most likely assignments for On Deck companies are:
• Reinforce a position within an assigned sector
• Crew relief within an assigned sector
• Any other tactical position assigned by the IC
• Rapid Intervention Crew
On Deck provides the IC with the ability to move companies from Level I or Level II staging to a forward
position providing a tactical reserve on the fire ground., On-Deck also allows the IC to maintain a
continuous work cycle in a sector and provide a back-up crew with immediate intervention capability in
any given sector (RIC).
Examples:
Garden apartment complexes, large commercial assignments and high rise fires are all examples of
where ‘On-Deck’ would be used to provide a tactical reserve and a RIC in forward sectors. House fires
are another situation where the use of On-Deck helps the IC function more efficiently. Rather than
piling additional companies into a small structure, the IC can place them On-Deck and wait for reports
from interior crews as to their manpower and resource needs. This placement also eliminates the need
to tie up personnel occupying a RIC (rescue) position.
On-Deck Company Use to Assist with a Rescue
The ability to respond quickly to a May-Day situation is one of the most important reasons to assign
companies to On-Deck positions. Assignment to the task of firefighter rescue requires a level-headed,
coordinated and quick approach. Companies assigned to On-Deck must prepare themselves to
function as rescue crews by performing the following tasks/actions:
• Monitor tactical radio channel;
• Retrieve RIC Bag and confirm contents;
• Confirm TIC is in a ready state;
• Determine which line each interior company is on—(hose tags);
• Coordinate the opening of doors and windows;
• Illuminate entrance/exits;
• Develop and discuss a possible search and rescue plan.
On-Deck Company Actions for Rescue include:
• Confirm May-Day information;
• Determine resource and equipment needs based upon May-Day report;
• Determine last known location of firefighter/crew in trouble;
• Communicate plan with crew;
• Implement Plan;
• Utilize information and technology (radio reports, TIC, flashlights, etc.);
• Monitor air supply;
• Provide C.A.N. report to Command.

C957 North and South
On all first alarm or greater incidents cars 957 north and south or BC152 will be dispatched and will fill
the role of a mobile AISO when assigned by the IC to provide an additional layer of safety. If C957 or
BC152 feels there is a need to enter the hot zone he/she must team up with the second C957 and
communicate with Command to describe conditions, the reason to enter the hot zone, and their plan.
The C957/BC152 team will not enter the hot zone until the IC approves their plan.
In addition to being company officers, C957 personnel are cross trained in Hazardous Materials and
Technical Rescue. This makes them a valuable resource at all Special Operations calls and may be
paired up to perform recon and mobile incident safety for the IC.
In addition to the above duties, C957 may be assigned the following duties:
• Secure Utilities
• Work with the responsible party at commercial or apartment fires
• Isolate known hazards
• Follow up with defined hazards such as lines down etc.
• Work with utility companies
Greater Alarms and Command Van (CV) operations
When transitioning to the CV the IC and support officer/FIT retain their positions as the IC and the
Support Officer/ISO. The IC and Support Officer now join the Senior Advisor and the three of them
become the Command Team. When an ISO qualified person arrives at the Command Post (CV), the
Senior Advisor may assign him/her to the position of ISO. The Support Officer (FIT) can now focus on
supporting the IC and the ISO can focus on Incident Safety.
The Incident Safety Officer (ISO) function operating in the Command Van (CV) works under the
direction of the Senior Advisor (SA) and provides the incident commander with a second set of eyes
and ears for fire ground operations. The presence of an ISO enables Command to set up a tactical
safety channel that can communicate location, accountability, resource needs, and sector safety
concerns to the command team without using valuable radio time from the tactical channel.
The tactical safety channel also provides for an additional communication tool for sector officers to
communicate with the command team in the event of a significant incident situation (“May Day” building
collapse, explosion, etc) that dominates radio traffic on the assigned incident channel. The channel
should not be used for tactical reports or resource requests unless contact on the tactical channel is
unavailable and the report or need is critical in nature.
STRATEGIC INCIDENT SAFETY OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES
• Identify the Safety Channel assigned by the dispatch center.
• Obtain a briefing from the Command Team that includes the incident action plan (IAP).
o The ISO monitors the IAP, conditions, activities and operations to determine whether they
fall within the criteria as defined in the department’s risk management plan. The ISO shall
take necessary action, through the IC, if activities do not fall within the risk management
plan.
• Using a tactical worksheet, identify the existing organizational structure.
o This can be accomplished by working with the CV staging officer by using the resource list
function of the staging officer’s computer.

Once Command has advised the tactical level (Sector) Safety Officers (AISO’s) to go to the
Safety Channel, contact each sector safety officer and assure that the department’s personnel
accountability system is being used and confirm resources assigned.
o Provide the SA with any differences between the organizational assignments Command has
and what is reported by the sector safety officers.
Provide the SA with any resource requests from sector safety officers.
Offer judgment to the SA on establishing control zones and no-entry zones and ensures that
established zones are communicated to all members present on the scene.
Ensure that the IC establishes the incident scene rehabilitation tactical level management
component during the emergency operation.
o Critical incident stress interventions should be recognized and the IC should be notified if
such circumstances require response.
The ISO shall communicate to the IC the need for additional safety officers and/or tactical
specialists due to the need, size, complexity or duration of the incident.

TACTICAL INCIDENT SAFETY OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES
• Identify the Safety Channel assigned by Command.
• Size up the sector of responsibility–
o Monitor the Sector Action Plan, conditions, activities and operations to determine
whether they fall within the criteria as defined in the department’s risk management plan.
o Alter, suspend, or terminate activities that are unsafe or involve an imminent hazard.
o Survey the sector – identify hazards and potential hazards
o Communicate the building size, layout, construction type,
• Assure that the department’s personnel accountability system is being used within the sector
and confirm resources assigned.
o Wear full protective clothing and SCBA and operate just outside the “hot zone”
o Confirm sector assignments and companies assigned to sector
o Utilize accountability tools provided at the task level (passports, hose line tags,
accountability boards, etc)
o Develop a rescue plan – revise the plan as conditions change
• Offer judgment to the ISO on establishing control zones and no-entry zones and ensure that
established zones are communicated to all members present in the sector.
o Ensure the safety of crews – make sure the proper equipment is being utilized and that
personnel are operating in a safe position
o Fire line tape (yellow) helps to control bystanders and the scene
o Hazard tape (white/red) helps to control firefighters
o No Access tape (red/black) identifies exclusion zones for all personnel
• Communicate the need for additional safety officers and/or tactical specialists in the Sector due
to size, complexity or duration of the incident to the ISO.
• Establish RIC team deployments in each hazard zone area.
o Assure that the RIC Bag (air and tools) have been deployed in the sector
• Advise the IC of hazards, fire extension and collapse potential.
o Forecast needs
• Evaluate visible smoke (color, volume, density, velocity, location)and fire conditions (location
and size) and advise Command on the potential for flashover, back draft, blow up, or other
events that could pose a threat to operating crews.

Monitor the accessibility of entry and egress of structures and its effect on the safety of
members conducting interior operations
o Track personnel accountability closer to building
o Air management – manage time on air/working time and work/rest cycles
o Manage on deck crews – share information, including rescue plan
o Manage the cycling of crews to rehab
o Progress reports
o Constantly monitor crews and building conditions
Develop an overhaul plan for the Sector that falls within the IAP

The additional layers of safety provided at this level of organization are:
• Provides a critical secondary means of communication during a Mayday
• Reconciling accountability (a cross check to make sure people are where command thinks
they are)
• Eliciting safety concerns from the Sector Safety Officers
• Completion of safety worksheet to include identification of safety issues and plan to mitigate
• Second means of strategic/tactical/safety communication with the command team
Transition to multi operation period events and a Type I or III Incident Management Team (IMT).
When the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) has decided that the scale, complexity, and duration of an
incident warrant the use of an IMT the ISO will participate with the Command Team in an interagency
briefing. The ISO will provide current safety issues during the briefing when appropriate. The IMT
Command Staff including the Safety Officer are the recipients of this briefing. Following the formal
briefing, the ISO will meet with the IMT Safety Officer and provide the current safety worksheet, and if
possible assist in the safety planning process for the upcoming operational period. More about
transitioning to an IMT appears in M.P. 201.01 Command Procedures.

SINGLE ISO – DEPLOYMENT MODEL

Departments in the consortium using the single ISO model either dispatch an ISO or assigns the ISO
position to a qualified Command or Company Officer during incidents. Command should only assign
units qualified and familiar with the ISO. Once the IC assigns an ISO they will be identified as SAFETY
on the tactical channel. Single ISO’s shall remain out of the hot zone unless they are paired up. Single
ISO’s should provide the following functions:
• Incident Recon
• Assess the risk/benefit of operations
• Communicate and report safety issues to command
• Intervene as necessary to provide for safety using one of the three methods described below
SAFETY INTERVENTION
Intervention at scene operations involves three approaches. First is for life threatening situations, the
second is for non-life threatening situations; the third approach occurs in the on-going incident planning
process.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

INCIDENT SAFETY OFFICER SYSTEM
M.P. 201.05A

(formerly Safety Sector/Section)

5/11–R

Page 9 of 9

First Approach- life threatening conditions:
Any LIFE THREATENING conditions will be corrected immediately and directly. Where time permits,
Command must be notified. Corrective action will be initiated by Command immediately. In obvious
life threatening situations that do not allow time for Command's intervention, the Safety Sector/Section
shall immediately stop any action, or countermand any order, under these circumstances by DIRECT
and IMMEDIATE intervention (i.e., order crews out of a building, countermand an order for crews to go
to the roof etc.). Such action may be taken with the understanding that the Safety Sector/group works
for Command and is accountable to Command for actions taken. COMMAND MUST BE
IMMEDIATELY ADVISED OF ANY DIRECT INTERVENTION BY THE SAFETY SECTOR/SECTION
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.
A change of strategy and/or tactics by Command or Sector officers may be required as a result of the
Safety officer's actions. Sector officers must be notified of hazards, required safety corrections, or
updated on the strategic plan, tactics, and objectives.
EMERGENCY TRAFFIC SHOULD BE USED FOR ANY CRITICAL EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS/
ALERTS REQUIRED AT THE INCIDENT SCENE!
Second approach- non life threatening conditions:
The second approach is for non-life threatening situations and involves a more "one on one" correction
of safety problems with individual firefighters, company officers, and/or sector officers (i.e. require
SCBA, correct ladder position) and often does not affect incident strategy. This approach is the most
frequent type of interaction. Where corrective action does not affect Command's strategy; Command
may not need to be notified. Corrected items should, however, be noted for discussion at a critique of
the incident.
Third approach- on going incident planning:
The third approach occurs in the on-going incident planning process. Upon the implementation of the
Safety Sector/Section, Command must provide the Safety Sector/Section an overview of the incident
action plan and specific details of the safety plan. The Safety officer, upon his/her arrival, will confirm
that a safety plan is in effect, review it, and provide recommendations as needed. In some cases
Command may request that the Safety Sector/Section officer develop a proposed safety plan and
recommendations for Command.
Command must be kept aware of any adjustments that affect overall site operations, or the strategic
plan, via frequent and timely progress reports.
The Safety Sector/group/ AISOs must remain a part of the on-going planning process with Command
and/or the Safety Officer.
The officer, assuming Safety Sector/group responsibilities, may utilize any previous Safety Sector
Officers to his/her best advantage, coordinating resources and incident assignments as approved by
Command.

Purpose
This procedure establishes a standard structure and guidelines for the provision of Support
Sector at all incidents requiring response from Resource Management, and incidents involving
special supply needs.
Procedure
The Resource Sector is a part of our Incident Command System and may be assigned under the
Logistics Section Officer. The responsibilities assigned to the Resource Sector will vary to some
degree in each situation depending on type, size and complexity of operations. The specific
responsibilities will include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Assisting the Logistics Section Officer in initial and continuing evaluation of support
needs.
Providing and re-supply of all expendable supplies, such as air, oxygen, medical supplies,
foam, Gatorade, food, etc.
Providing and coordinating field refueling of apparatus.
Liaison with Equipment Management to provide for the ongoing performance of all
Department apparatus.
Providing and coordinating equipment and manpower for delivery of fire hose and other
equipment to the scene and/or back to stations.
Provide for the delivery to the incident site of specialized and backup equipment, as
may be needed.
Coordinate provision of specialized equipment or services required at the scene from
other City departments or outside agencies, and provide liaison as required.
Coordinate the exchange of portable radios and communications equipment requiring
servicing.

It is the responsibility of Command to make an early determination of situations requiring the
establishment of the Resource Sector or the Logistics Section, and to assure that the Resource
Officer (RM-50) on call has been notified and is responding to the incident. Notification can be
made through Deployment. Command may assign an individual or company to establish a
Resource Sector prior to the arrival of the Resource Officer.
It is the responsibility of the Resource Management Deputy Chief to provide the designated
personnel and response capability to meet the requirements of this procedure. This response
capability is available on a 24-hour basis through the on-duty Resource Officer (RM-50).

PHOENIX REGIONAL

Page 2 of 2

It is the responsibility of RM-50 to respond to all working first alarm incidents or greater, or any
other incident where response is requested by Command. RM-50 will report to the Command
Post on arrival and verify establishment of the Resource Sector.
RM-50 will check with Command for any particular needs or problems which have been
identified. Unless otherwise directed, RM-50 will automatically assess the situation in terms of
support requirements. RM-50 will coordinate the response of additional Resource personnel
and make assignments to provide for completion of assigned responsibilities.
RM-50 will remain at the Command Post and respond to any particular needs identified by
Command or the Logistics Officer. Progress reports will be made to Command or the Logistics
Officer as necessary. RM-50 is responsible for determination and notification of personnel at
the Resource Management facility, if necessary, to further support Resource Sector needs on
the incident. For major incidents, the Resource Management Deputy Chief will respond to the
incident to manage Resource Sector. Other Resource Management Division Officers and Section
heads may be requested to respond to the scene of all second alarm incidents or greater.
Fleet Management provides 24-hour service to maintain apparatus and equipment and to meet
emergency needs of the Department. This service is maintained by three Fire Engineers
working a 56-hour week. The on-duty Fire Engineer may be contacted at 261-8744.

12/19-SR

The following outlines the directives for Lobby Sector.
PROCEDURE
Lobby Sector is used to control access to a building or area during fires, hazardous materials incidents, rescue
operations or any other situation where it is necessary to control and maintain accountability for the entry and
exit of personnel. The Lobby Sector Officer is responsible for the following:
1. Identified all entrance/exit points
2. Control all access points when alternate entrances are present
3. Identify suitable entrance/exit point or location
4. Maintain full accountability
5. Record names, times and assignment of personnel
6. Collect all accountability tags
7. For High-rise buildings, normally Lobby Sector is the ground floor lobby area
8. Special Ops Incident: Define perimeter with HAZARD ZONE tape
***Limit entry to authorized personnel with appropriate PPE***
OPERATIONAL INFORMATION
Lobby Sector is used to control access to a building or area necessary to maintain and control accountability for
the entry and exit of personnel. Access control is established at an identified entrance/exit point from the
building or area involved. In the case of a high-rise building this is normally the ground floor lobby area. In
other cases it may be any suitable entrance/exit point or a location designated to meet the needs of the
situation.
In the case of a technical operation, e.g., hazardous materials incident, trench rescue, or confined space, the
perimeter shall be defined by HAZARD ZONE tape with an entrance/exit point identified.
The Lobby Sector is the only location where personnel shall enter or exit from the controlled area in order to
maintain full accountability. Lobby Sector personnel must control all access points when alternate entrances are
available.
Lobby Sector personnel will limit entry into a controlled building or area to those authorized by Command and
having the required level of protective clothing and equipment appropriate for the situation.
The Lobby Sector will record the names, times, and assignments of all personnel entering and exiting the
controlled area. Accountability tags will be collected from all personnel entering and should be retrieved on
departure.

BUILDING/AREA ACCESS CONTROL
A Lobby Sector should be established by Command at high-rise fires and other situations where control of access
is necessary. When beginning operations at these incidents, at least one firefighter from the initial arriving
companies should be left to establish a Lobby Sector. A company should be assigned to establish Lobby Sector
as quickly as possible and additional resources may be needed in major situations.
When Lobby Sector is established all personnel entering the building or area must report to Lobby Sector before
reporting to any other sector or assignment. Company Officers will keep crews intact while awaiting
assignment. Civilian personnel entering the building area shall be accompanied by a firefighter with a portable
radio.
For primary responsibilities assigned to the Lobby Sector at a High-rise building incident see High-rise Plans
procedure.
Other incidents that may require a Lobby Sector shall include hazardous materials, confined space, trench
rescue, water rescue, structural collapse, and any other incident where control of access is critical.

The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines for handling large-scale events during and after fire
ground mitigation. These incidents could include multiple alarm fires, fires involving hazardous materials, major
spills, leaks, and other significant events that may result in environmental contamination or have a major impact
on the operation of City services. Many times the process of handling large-scale fires and associated
environmental impacts, especially those involving hazardous materials, is much more involved and time
consuming than the actual extinguishment of the fire.
Environmental Sector is responsible for the following:
1. EMERGENCY CONTACTS
The following is a list of contacts that shall be notified and respond to these types of incidents:
a. Phoenix Fire Department Special Operations Section designee. This person will coordinate the activities
of the following agencies and assure communications regarding the event to the Incident Commander &
Executive Staff of the Department.

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide guidelines to conduct an evacuation of citizens in a geographic area
during an emergency incident. The potential for evacuation should be considered during all emergency
incidents. The key to an organized and manageable evacuation is to develop an Incident Command System
early and initiate a plan and to continually update the plan.
A plan for evacuation should address the following factors:
1. A Command structure
2. Determine the need for evacuation versus in-place sheltering
3. Early notification of the Police Department
4. Identification of an area to be evacuated, perimeters, etc.
5. Required resources
6. Evacuation time frame
7. Identification of shelter sites and preparation of these sites
8. Duration of the evacuation
9. Re-entry of those evacuated
10. Information about the hazard and evacuation presented to evacuees (multi-lingual)
11. Follow-up with evacuees upon re-entry
12. Security of the area evacuated
Other areas which will need to be considered also include:
1. Activation of the Emergency Operations Center (EOC)
2. Assignment of a Police Liaison Sector
3. Communications
4. Media support (PIO)
5. Establishing a Transportation Branch/Sector for evacuees
6. Communicating evacuation plan and shelter sites to the Command organizations of all agencies involved
AREA OF EVACUATION
The area of initial evacuation should be identified by the Incident Commander. The Planning Section will reevaluate the evacuation area and recommend any necessary adjustments. The evacuation boundaries should
follow streets and established roadways. A map should be utilized and distributed to all officers and agencies
involved. Maps need to be provided to the Evacuation Branch and the Police Department.
In some situations, in-place sheltering can be used to protect the public rather than initiating an evacuation. Inplace sheltering can be considered during the following circumstances:
1. The hazardous material has been identified as having a low or moderate level of health risk
2. The material has been released from its container and is now dissipating
3. Leaks can be controlled rapidly and before evacuation can be completed

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Evacuation Sector

M.P. 201.05E

11/14-R

12/19-SR

4. Exposure to the product is expected to be short-term and of low health risk
5. The public can be adequately protected by staying indoors
Command may need to provide instructions to the affected public such as the need to stay indoors shutting
down their evaporative cooling systems and closing all doors and windows.
LEVELS OF EVACUATION
There are three levels of evacuation. Each requires a different resource commitment. They include:
1. SITE EVACUATION
Site evacuation involves a small number of citizens. This typically includes workers at the site and people from
adjacent occupancies or areas. The citizens are easily evacuated and collected upwind of the perimeter area.
Evacuation holding times are typically short, generally less than an hour or two, and citizens are permitted to
return to their businesses or homes.
2. INTERMEDIATE LEVEL EVACUATION
The Intermediate Level involves larger numbers of citizens and/or affects a larger area. This level affects off-site
homes and businesses and normally affects fewer than 100 people. People may remain out of the area for two
to four hours or more. Evacuation completion times will be somewhat longer than a site evacuation but
generally rapid. Collecting, documenting and controlling the evacuees becomes more difficult. Off-site
collection sites or shelter areas will need to be determined and managed. Some evacuees will leave the area on
their own or be sent home by employers. Site perimeters become larger and perimeter security requires more
resources. Close coordination with the Police Department and other agencies will be required.
3. LARGE-SCALE EVACUATION
A large or concentrated release of a hazardous substance may cause a large scale evacuation. Thousands of
citizens could be evacuated. Rapid initiation of the evacuation process may be required. Evacuees may be out
of their homes and businesses for many hours if not days. Evacuation completion time frames will be extended.
Evacuation shelters will need to be located, opened and managed. Documentation and tracking of evacuees
becomes more important as well as more difficult. Very close coordination with the police and other agencies
will be required. Site and evacuation perimeters become extended and require much more resources to
maintain. Security of the evacuated area is always a concern. The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) will be
activated to support the evacuation and site operations.
There are no precise parameters differentiating one level of evacuation from another. The Incident
Commander must implement a Command Organization that meets the needs of each particular incident.

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Evacuation Sector

M.P. 201.05E

11/14-R

12/19-SR

DURATION OF EVACUATION
The evacuation should be sustained as long as the risk continues in the evacuated area. Caution should be
taken when deciding to allow residents to return to their homes to ensure that the situation is truly under
control. Re-evacuating is difficult to complete as many residents will not want to go a second time. It can also
be extremely hazardous. Evacuees must be updated with information as soon as possible and periodically
throughout the incident.
WHO SHOULD BE EVACUATED
All residents living/working in the area identified should be evacuated. In the event that a resident decides not
to evacuate, they should be specifically informed of the risk and, if they still refuse, left to stay. The Evacuation
Branch is to be notified and a note of the citizen's address made for further follow-up.
RED CROSS RESPONSIBILITIES
Once long-term sheltering is identified, the Red Cross will manage shelters. Early notification is required. The
Red Cross will need up to three hours to get adequate personnel, equipment and supplies to the shelter sites.
SHELTER SITES
When developing the evacuation plan, shelter sites must be identified early. Shelter site selection cannot wait
on the Red Cross. Site selection must be made by the Incident Commander at the time evacuation is ordered
and sites need Sector officers assigned.
Some Fire department resources will need to be committed to the shelters, particularly in the area of initial
opening and staffing by a shelter crew, and later for potential emergency medical support and information
management.
A Red Cross representative should be assigned to each shelter. An Occupant Services officer should also be
assigned to each shelter.
COMMAND STRUCTURE
The Planning Section is responsible for all planning associated with the evacuation. The evacuation plan is
communicated to the Incident Commander for approval or modification. The actual evacuation process would
normally be managed in the Operations Section as an Evacuation Branch or Sector. The Evacuation Branch
must be provided with sufficient resources to effectively complete the task. Sector assignments within the
Evacuation Branch will be assigned as necessary. The following Sections may be implemented:
1. Operations Section
2. Planning Section
3. Logistics Section
4. Administration Section

13. Monitor, support and revise the evacuation process as necessary
14. Evacuate persons from the greatest danger first
15. Assign specific areas to evacuate in order to avoid duplication or missed areas [use Fire department
map book - either page numbers (e.g., NE0107) or hydrant zone numbers as grids]
16. Provide the transportation necessary for evacuees
17. Provide continuing command of the evacuation, de-commitment and return of evacuees
18. Determine the need to implement a unified command structure involving other agencies (this would
depend upon the nature of the incident)
COMMUNICATIONS
A separate radio frequency should be used for the Evacuation Branch. This should be assigned as early in the
incident as possible.
DISPATCH AND DEPLOYMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
1. Dispatch appropriate resources as requested
2. Notify the appropriate Fire and City officials
3. Notify the appropriate support agencies as requested or listed in Standard Operating Procedures
4. Initiate recall of additional Dispatch staff to meet the demands of the incident
5. Notify the City telephone switchboard operator and provide the operator a status report. Update the
operator as needed
6. Notify the hospitals in the area of evacuation (both those exposed and not exposed) and provide a
status report and updates as needed (intermediate and large-scale evacuations)
7. Update Fire Administration staff of the status of the incident if it is during normal business hours (they
will receive many calls from citizens requesting information)
PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER'S RESPONSIBILITIES
1. Establish PIO Sector
2. Notify the news media and provide status reports and updates as necessary
3. Provide the media with consistent and accurate evacuation instructions as provided by Command
4. Utilize the media and coordinate evacuation notices through news media
MEDIA SUPPORT
The incident PIO should be informed of the evacuation plan so that the media is aware of the areas to be
evacuated, shelter sites and any evacuation instructions to the public. The PIO should make every effort to
assemble the media at the scene to keep them away from hazards and out of the evacuation area. Residents
may receive information from the media during the evacuation, so it is critical that the media information be
accurate.
Also needed is a single phone number that should be released to the public for information.

POLICE LIAISON
A police representative will need to be assigned to the Planning Section and another to the Evacuation Branch
as a liaison. The police liaisons will communicate with the Police Incident Commander and keep other parties in
the Police Department informed of the plan, progress, etc.
POLICE RESPONSIBILITIES
The Police Department will be an integral part of the evacuation process, as a large portion of the evacuation is
usually accomplished by the Police Department. Police responsibilities include:
1. Provide a ranking officer to the Incident Command Post
2. Provide a ranking officer to the Evacuation Branch/Sector
3. Develop a Police Incident Command System to manage police operations
4. Provide a communication system for police resources
5. Provide police resources needed for evacuation
6. Provide traffic control and traffic routing
7. Provide perimeter security
8. Provide evacuation zone security
9. Identify transportation needs
EVACUATION BRANCH RESPONSIBILITIES
On large-scale evacuations, a Branch level position on a separate radio channel will be necessary. Sectors will
also need to be established and report to the Evacuation Branch officer.
Typically, a large commitment of police officers will be required to accomplish an evacuation. The Evacuation
Branch officer may be either a police or fire officer. The Evacuation Branch must obtain a ranking police official
at his/her location in order to closely coordinate evacuation efforts. An appropriate commitment of police
resources must be obtained. Evacuation responsibilities include:
1. Obtain resources needed to evacuate
2. Obtain ranking police officer as liaison
3. Provide a ranking fire officer to serve as or support the Branch officer
4. Establish Sectors as needed
5. Provide Sectors objectives and specific areas to evacuate (use Fire department map pages or hydrant
zones in Fire department map book for grids)
6. Provide Sectors with shelter location and instructions
7. Provide Sectors with evacuation instruction pads and written evacuation information for evacuees if
possible (consider needs for multiple languages)
8. Provide Sectors with private vehicle routing instructions (out of the area)
9. Obtain/provide ambulances, buses or other transportation to those requiring transportation out of the
area
10. Evacuate those at greatest risk first

Evacuation Sector

M.P. 201.05E

11/14-R

12/19-SR

11. Evacuate the greatest concentrated areas next (e.g., apartment complex)
12. Consider individual Sectors for large population occupancies (e.g., multi-story buildings, large apartment
complexes, schools, etc.)
13. As individual geographic or grid Sectors complete their evacuations, terminate the Sector identity and
reassign resources to other developing Sectors (for large-scale evacuation)
14. Closely document and maintain records of the evacuation process to avoid duplication or missed areas
15. Document those addressees and times for those refusing to leave
INFORMATION AND NOTIFICATION
The Police Department and fire companies should be used for resources/staffing to conduct a walk-through or
drive-through in the area to be evacuated. Fire companies should be assigned to hazardous areas with police
assigned to safe areas. The officers should provide residents with information about the situation and be told
that they are being evacuated, to where, and why. It is necessary to inform the residents of shelter areas being
established to minimize confusion and anxiety.
ON-SITE NOTIFICATION TO EVACUATE
Door-to-door notification is time-consuming. In many cases, adequate resources and time is not available to do
this type of face-to-face notification. Use of sirens, air horns and PA systems will speed the alert process.
When making door-to-door evacuations:
1. Be in uniform
2. Wear your helmet
Face-to-face notification should include the following instructions:
1. There is an emergency
2. You are in danger
3. Leave immediately
4. Go to shelter (location)
5. Take (
) route out of area
6. Do you need transportation?
7. Consider multi-lingual needs
Evacuees should be advised to take the following items:
1. Wallet/purse
2. House and car keys
3. Money
4. Eyeglasses
5. Medications
6. Proper/warm clothing
7. Family pet
In other situations, where immediate and rapid evacuation makes door-to-door notification impossible, use the
following notification method:

Use three (3) five-second blasts of the siren while on the "YELP" setting
Follow with the standard evacuation instruction over PA system (see instructions above)
Use maximum volume on PA system
Proceed slowly to maximize notification
Initiate notification at the beginning of each block and each 50 yards after that

***Once each assigned grid of objectives is complete, report completion to the Evacuation Branch/Sector
Officer***
An information phone line may need to be set up to provide an information source for citizens with concerns
about the incident. This information would be for family members affected by the evacuation or medical
information for Haz Mat incidents and general information about the evacuation.
REFUSAL TO LEAVE
Evacuations follow somewhat of a triage philosophy; we will evacuate the greatest number for the greatest
benefit. Individual refusals will be left to fend for themselves. There simply may not be enough time or
resources to initiate forced removal of persons from their homes. However, documentation of the refusal
should be done. Write the address down (or if radio traffic permits, radio the address to the Evacuation
Branch). A few methods of persuasion include:
1. Be in uniform
2. Wear your helmet
3. Wear SCBA and facepiece (air hose may not need to be connected) when advising the citizen to leave
4. Ask for next of kin and a phone number
5. Write the next of kin information down
6. Refusals should be noted and reported to the Branch Officer by radio
TRANSPORTATION BRANCH/SECTOR
A Transportation Sector should be established within the Evacuation Branch. Ambulances and other transport
vehicles should be staged in the event that a citizen may need transportation to a shelter or other location.
Non-ambulatory people must be located and information provided to the Transportation Sector so that they are
not overlooked in the evacuation. Transportation Branch/Sector responsibilities include:
1. Obtain buses (start with a minimum of two) and other vehicles that can be used for transportation
2. Stage all transportation resources
3. Put one firefighter (or police officer) on each vehicle equipped with a fire or police department radio
4. Coordinate the Evacuation Sector (or Evacuation Branch) pick-up points or addresses of those citizens
needing transportation

EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER (EOC)
If a significant or major evacuation occurs, the City's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) will be activated. The
EOC will collect department heads and senior staff from the Fire, Police, City Manager's office, Public Works and
other City departments to the EOC. The EOC's objective is to use the City's resources to support the incident.
Command should be prepared for this support and potential policy direction in regards to the incident and
evacuation operations.
If the EOC is in operation, the Planning Section is responsible for briefing and maintaining communication with
the EOC. A radio communications link (another radio channel) with the EOC and a cellular telephone link may
be required. If the EOC has a CAD terminal, the EOC liaison will need access to an MCT. Responsibilities of the
Planning Section's EOC Liaison Officer are:
1. Obtain a radio communications link with the EOC (through Dispatch Headquarters on a separate
channel)
2. Obtain a cellular telephone or other communications link with the EOC (City of Phoenix EOC phone
numbers: 262-6100, 262-6664, 262-7293)
3. Obtain an immediate status report from Command and provide that report to the EOC Fire Officer
4. Provide an immediate report to the EOC on any changes in plans, strategy, problems encountered, etc
5. Provide progress reports every 30 minutes unless the EOC requires more frequent reports
6. Act as the communications link from EOC to Command
7. Provide Command with direction, policy information, etc., that is communicated from the EOC
Once established, the EOC will usually remain in operation for the duration of the evacuation. Command will
maintain an EOC liaison and a communication link with the EOC throughout the evacuation, including
decommitment and return of evacuees.
RETURN EVACUEES
The decision to return evacuees to their homes will be the sole responsibility of the fire department Incident
Commander. If the EOC is operating, the decision to return evacuees will be made by the EOC staff. No other
City agency will be authorized to order the return.
The Planning Section will jointly develop a return plan for evacuees.
Returning evacuees may require some transportation be provided. A Transportation Sector should be
reactivated to organize these needs.

INTRODUCTION
It is the policy of the Phoenix Fire Department to establish and maintain a positive working relationship
with the media.
This directive will establish a standard operating procedure to provide the media with information
normally requested from the Fire Department on emergency incidents, to monitor the movements of
media personnel for safety reasons, and to establish an operating framework for an Information Sector
that will effectively integrate into the overall incident management system.
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Command will be responsible for the assignment of an Information Sector on the fireground or any
significant incident. As soon as practical, after basic rescue and fire operations are extended,
Command will establish an Information Sector. The establishment of this sector will relieve Command
of the responsibility of dealing directly with the media during critical Command stages and provide
standard information the media will require to accurately report the emergency.
The Public Information Officer (PIO) will report to Command, upon arrival, and establish an Information
Sector if not already established.
NOTE: If a fire company or other fire department member has been assigned Information Sector
responsibilities the PIO will report to the sector location, receive a briefing from the sector officer, and
assist as needed. The PIO may assume sector responsibilities at his/her discretion.
Radio designation will be "Public Information Sector."
Individuals assigned to perform this sector function should consider the following general guidelines:
Basic Information:
A. Timely response
B. Number of units and personnel on-scene
C. Human Interest or Safety Information
If possible, add anything to the basic information that will enhance the story; such information might
include:
A. Highly skilled and trained professionals (high rise, technical rescue, etc.)
B. An extremely hazardous situation
C. A person or company that did an outstanding job on or off duty fire fighter involvement
D. A rescue scenario
E. Projected duration of incident

This information will assist the reporters in their coverage of the incident and enhance the quality
and accuracy of their stories.
When possible, an interview with the company officer or crewmember is encouraged. Don't be
afraid to talk to reporters. They will report the facts you give them.
Every effort should be made to provide accurate information.

Usually, while gathering information, you will have inquiries from reporters. Provide the information you
have at that point and emphasize that this information is preliminary. If it gets to the point that
questions from reporters are keeping you from gathering information, use these alternatives:
1. Tell the reporters to gather in one place and that you will return shortly with more
information.
2. Request additional manpower from Command to assist in gathering information and remain
with the reporters.
3. Tell the reporters to go ahead and get pictures and film footage without interfering with
incident operations while you are gathering information. Certified Fire Journalists (CFJ),
identified by their green helmets and fire journalist identification, may be assigned to
sectors. Journalists without green helmets or the proper CFJ identification will not be
assigned to a sector and will be required to remain outside the incident perimeter. Make
sure and point out the hazard zone. Arrange to meet with them shortly and give them any
additional or updated information.
4. If they have deadlines to meet, get a phone number(s) where they can be reached and
phone them as soon as possible.
5. BEFORE RELEASING NAMES OF PERSONS SERIOUSLY INJURED OR DECEASED
CONFIRM THAT NEXT OF KIN HAS BEEN NOTIFIED. Notifications are usually handled
by police and/or hospitals. Ask the Dispatch supervisor to check with PD or hospital to
confirm that next of kin has been notified. DO NOT USE THE NAMES OF DECEASED OR
SERIOUSLY INJURED PERSONS IN YOUR INTERVIEW OR OVER THE RADIO UNTIL
NOTIFICATION OF NEXT OF KIN HAS BEEN CONFIRMED. Ask for assistance from the
PIO office.
6. Do not speculate as to the cause of a fire or car accident.
The individual or company assigned to the Information Sector may be required to escort the media on a
tour of the fire damage area following knockdown. This must be cleared with Command and
coordinated with operating sectors prior to entering the area.
The Information Sector will be responsible for insuring that all media personnel wear proper protective
clothing on the fireground or any other area when needed.
Each Sector Officer is responsible for the safety of media personnel in the area. If media personnel
create a safety problem, or hinder operations, they will be requested to move. AVOID
CONFRONTATIONS! The policy of the Department is to cooperate with the media.

Page 1 of 14

Post-incident critiques of major and significant incidents provides an opportunity to review the
effectiveness of actions and procedures in their application during actual incidents. It is also an
opportunity to review the overall quality of the services provided to the customers at the incident. This
review is extremely valuable in improving procedures and incident operations. Formal departmental
critiques will be conducted at the discretion of the Tactical Services Chief.
Critique Sector--Implementation
An incident Critique Sector may be utilized at major incidents. This sector will be implemented
automatically by the Training Academy officer responding to the incident. Command must be notified of
the Critique Sector's establishment. In the absence of an Training Academy officer, the Tactical
Services chief or the Incident Commander will designate a fire officer to implement this Sector.
A critique "team" may also be implemented as part of the Critique Sector at greater alarms, or other
significant incidents at the request of Command, to prepare and conduct a critique. Command must be
notified of the Critique Sector's establishment. The Tactical Services Chief, or his/her designee, will

1. Individual--Conducted within the individual company by the company officer. May include other
companies. Usually self initiated by the company officer. No documentation of the critique
required.
2. Company Level--Post-incident critique conducted on site, prior to departing the scene. Initiated
by Command or battalion chief. Informal and brief.
3. Battalion Level--Initiated and organized by the battalion chief. Scheduled assembly of the
necessary companies as soon as possible after the incident. Structured critique format.
Battalion chief completes critique analysis form and forwards to the Tactical Services Section.
4. Operations Level--Conducted within the battalion by the battalion chief or Shift Commander.
This may be a first alarm or multiple-alarm incident, or other significant incident whose site
operations were uncomplicated, and generally did not involve a large response of fire
department resource or outside agencies. A standard critique packet will be utilized to prepare
for and conduct the critique. A critique summary will be completed. All critique materials and
documents will be forwarded to the Tactical Services Section for filing.
5. Department Level--Utilized for critiquing large-scale or complex incidents that involved a large
response of fire department resources and several outside agencies or incidents that were
unusual or tactically significant occurrences. A chief officer will be selected to prepare and
conduct the critique. A team may be assigned to assist also. A standard critique packet will be
utilized to prepare for and conduct the critique. A critique summary will be completed. All
critique materials and documents will be forwarded to the Tactical Services Section. The
Tactical Services Section will be responsible for coordinating the date and location of
department level critiques and making Buckslip and other notifications.
This critique will require greater coordination, investigation, and preparation. It will be conducted at a
selected location to accommodate a large attendance.

Since a major incident affects all divisions and sections of the department in one degree or another, the
operations and department level critique will review the total incident response rather than just simply
the site operations aspects of the incident. A thorough critique of major incidents may require the
assistance of several divisions or sections. Therefore, the following Divisions and Sections will be
asked to submit at least the following information/materials. Turnaround for submitting the information
to the Tactical Services chief will be ten (10) calendar days.

Off-Duty/Out-of-Town Event
Should an incident occur while the member is off-duty or out of town/out of state, the
Appropriate Deputy Chief will immediately be notified.
The Appropriate Deputy Chief will assume the initial Welfare Sector responsibilities or assign
these responsibilities to another Chief Officer. Duties will include:
•
•
•
•
•

Notify the Fire Chief and Senior Staff.
Notify the Good and Welfare Officer.
Assign a Family Liaison Officer.
Assign a Hospital Liaison Officer (for Phoenix metro area hospitals).
Implement the appropriate items listed in this procedure.

For events out of the Phoenix metro area, or out of state, it may be necessary to contact the
Local Fire Department, as well as the Local Firefighters Union, to serve as the initial Hospital
Liaison Officer and to provide other assistance.
Fire Department Member Responsibilities
Fire department members and co-workers will be highly concerned in these incidents.
Members must understand that the Welfare Sector is designed to provide rapid, and accurate,
support to the family. It is important that members not “freelance” and take self-initiated
action. This kind of action in the past has often resulted in inaccurate information delivered to
the family member, or the family transported to the wrong hospital. This only increases the
emotional stress for the family.
Those members desiring to help should contact the Welfare Sector Officer. The system is
designed to absorb the assistance to, as well as, provide the maximum support to family
members.
Transfer of Welfare Sector Duties
During escalating serious incidents, the Welfare Sector responsibilities may be transferred to
the Assistant Chief of Personnel Division, or a designee. At some point, the “crisis” management
part of the Welfare Sector will stabilize. At this stage, duties may be transferred to the Welfare
Officer at the Health Clinic for ongoing monitoring and support.

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to define the roles and responsibilities of the Threat Liaison
Officer (TLO) in the Phoenix Regional Response System.
OVERVIEW
A large proportion of fire company responses involve some interaction of a routine nature
between Law Enforcement and Fire personnel. These incidents are regularly and routinely
handled in a very successful manner between the Company Officer and the Police Officers or
Supervisors that respond. When incidents occur that require coordination and communication
between law enforcement tactical units and fire companies, a request for the TLO of the
jurisdiction having authority (JHA) shall be made to ensure all involved agencies work
effectively. This coordination and communication is critical to ensure the safety of the
community and the public safety personnel.
The request for the TLO is made using an incident assigned tactical channel or by contacting
the appropriate regional dispatch center.
•
•

For those agencies dispatched by the Phoenix Regional Dispatch Center, contact the
Alarm Room Supervisor via phone at (602) 262-7496.
For those agencies dispatched by the Mesa Regional Dispatch Center, contact the
Alarm Room Supervisor via phone at (480) 644-2609.

The regional dispatch center will then contact the appropriate TLO for the jurisdiction, or
representative assigned, share pertinent information, and determine the requirement for a
response. The on-duty TLO will then contact the agency requesting assistance for additional
information, intelligence, and determination of what type of response will be required. In most
cases, this will include the initiation of a TLO nature code. For example, in the Phoenix Regional
Dispatch System, the on-duty TLO will initiate a TLO-Operation (TLOOPS CAD nature code)
and request the appropriate resources for the incident.
The TLO will assist in activities requiring coordination between the respective fire and law
enforcement agencies. This includes but is not limited to:
•

Law enforcement tactical operations, for example:
o Special Assignment Units (SAU) or Special Weapons & Tactics (SWAT)
o Fugitive Apprehension Investigations Detail (FAID)
o Street Crimes
o Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)
o Phase 1 Barricades

Any nature code included in the following list:
o 962PD, A3, ARFMR, BARHOS, CRASH, DL, GSW2, GSW2PD, GSW2S,
GSW3, GSW3PD, GSW3S, GSWACT, GSWPD, GSWPDS, GSWSPD, INJPD,
JUMP, NBC, STAB2, STAB2S, STAB3, VIACT
Any request made by fire department or law enforcement personnel that require
additional coordination or an extended operation related to a law enforcement incident.

The assigned TLO will be responsible for determining each situation's specific needs and
communicating them to the law enforcement supervisor. The fire and law enforcement TLOs
should remain at the Command Post to facilitate continuing communications.
INCIDENT RESPONSE
Incidents that meet the mission of law enforcement are led by the law enforcement agency
having authority. These incidents may require Fire, EMS, or Special Operations functions to
work in conjunction or coordination with law enforcement to mitigate or react to a potential
hazard. In these situations, the Fire TLO should report to the Police Command Post to
coordinate requests for assistance from the Police Department.
At times, the on duty TLO will be asked to support law enforcement activities in other
municipalities. The on duty TLO will make the appropriate notifications to the TLO in the
responding jurisdiction in which municipality the law enforcement operation will take place in.
Any TLO responding to a law enforcement request that requires action in any other city or
jurisdiction shall communicate this response to the on-duty TLO for that jurisdiction (or
appropriate agency). At no time should a Fire TLO from any jurisdiction open a TLO-Operation
incident and request resources without first notifying the TLO in the municipality of the
operation.
A TLO-Operation shall require a TLO to serve as a liaison for fire response, coordinating efforts
with their law enforcement counterpart, intelligence officer, and Incident Commander. TLOOperations cannot be managed by any fire-based tactical EMS resource at any incident,
regardless of whether they are a trained TLO or not. These fire-based tactical EMS resources
include trained SWAT Medics, or TEMS personnel (or units).
Anytime a fire-based tactical EMS resource requests assistance, the Alarm Room Supervisor
should notify the on duty TLO for that jurisdiction. An on scene TLO, working outside of the
hazard zone, and dedicated to this function, must act as the liaison for fire companies at any
law enforcement incident. This is to ensure effective communication, coordination, and
operational focus between fire companies and law enforcement personnel.

3 DEEP DEPLOYMENT MODEL & ADDITIONAL RESOURCES
M.P. 201.06

Page 1 of 3

POLICY
The decisions required to provide for adequate resources are an important factor in
effective emergency incident management. The Incident Commander (IC) must balance
the tactical problems with the resources required to control those problems and stay
ahead of the situation through effective forecasting. Beware of "Crisis Management."
Crisis management is often a situation that grows at a rate faster than the response rate
to that situation. Often times the IC ends up with an out of control situation and
inadequate resources to control it. Many times, the IC will reach a point where they begin
to debate whether to call another alarm or not, in such cases call for it. If the extra
resources are not needed, they can easily be put back in service.
3 DEEP DEPLOYMENT MODEL
Command must provide for a tactical reserve of fire companies. Command must deploy
resources in support of their incident action plan. Command must have enough
resources to provide for a tactical reserve of fire companies deployed in appropriate
forward positions. This is to manage the strategic and tactical needs of the incident or
sector and provide a reserve of resources to address a firefighter rescue should one
arise. Command should expand the incident organization through sectorization and
should utilize a 3-deep deployment model for resources within those sectors. The 3-deep
deployment model for managing resources is as follows:
• Working
• On-Deck
• Recycle/Staged
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES
In most cases, Command should utilize the greater alarm mechanism, it is the quickest,
provides for automatic move-ups and provides the support necessary for the additional
resources/expanding incident. Command should resist the temptation to request
assistance in a piecemeal fashion. Additional alarms should be struck sequentially which
includes going from a 3 & 1 assignment, to a 1st alarm, to a 2nd alarm, etc. It is the
continuing responsibility and function of Command to determine the resources required
to control the situation and to provide for the timely call for any additional resources
required.
The early call for additional resources will tend to consistently save the day. Command
must be aware of both the capability and response time of additional resources and
effectively integrate these factors in their decision to call more resources. Some tactical

situations move slowly, while some move very quickly. Command must call for
additional resources at a rate that stays ahead of the incident. Some situations require
the categorical call for additional alarms or upgrading an assignment upon knowledge of
particular characteristics or conditions. In other situations, Command will initiate some
fire control activities, ask for reports and, based upon receipt of bad news, will strike
more alarms.
When calling for additional resources, Command must expand the incident organization
to manage those additional resources. Command cannot encounter a big fire situation,
call additional alarms and then expect to effectively manage those additional resources
without expanding the incident organization through sectorization.
The following provides some examples of situations that will necessitate additional
resources:
• An actual or potential fire situation exists, and the life hazard exceeds the rescue
EMS capabilities of initial alarm companies.
• The number, location and condition of actual victims exceeds the
rescue/removal/treatment capabilities of companies.
• An actual or potential fire situation exists, and the property protection demand
exceeds the fire control capabilities of initial alarm companies.
• Fire conditions become more severe or the situation deteriorates significantly.
• All companies have been committed and the fire is not controlled.
• Command forecasts that forces could be depleted due to exhaustion; command
must forecast the effect the fire will have on personnel and provide for the support
of such personnel in advance.
• Command anticipates running out of some resource (firefighters, apparatus,
water, equipment, command officers, etc.).
• There is evidence of significant fire, but companies are unable to determine
location and extent.
• The commitment of companies is not effective.
• Companies cannot effectively perform early loss control operations.
• Situation becomes so widespread/complex that Command can no longer
effectively manage; the situation requires a larger command organization and
more sector functions.
• The weather is or has the potential to have a particularly exhausting effect on
resources.

SCOPE
Several public and private helicopter services are available for various purposes, including emergency
medical transportation, rescue from inaccessible locations, aerial reconnaissance of emergency
scenes, brush firefighting, and emergency transportation of personnel and/or equipment.
The agencies involved in these services and available for emergencies are:
Air Evac
Life Net
Mesa Police Department
Native Air
Department of Public Safety
Phoenix Police Department
Sheriff's Department
Arizona Army National Guard
Television Stations Channels 3, 5, 10, 12, 15
Air Services International
PROCEDURES
Each agency's operating procedures, along with equipment and training limitations, present different
operational capabilities. Command should request the type of helicopter and pilot support needed for a
particular situation. Information on each agency is maintained in the CAD system.
Fire personnel should not fly with pilots or in aircraft that have not been approved and appropriately
carded. If Command has a concern about the ability of the pilot or the overall safety of the operation,
Command should stop the operation immediately.
EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION
Helicopter transportation is available for patients within city areas, when time and distance affect
ground transportation time. When sufficient ambulances are unavailable, or when patients are in
locations inaccessible to ground units, helicopter transportation should be considered.
Med-Evac helicopters are capable of carrying; only one Immediate patient. Additional helicopters
should be requested for incidents involving multiple Immediate patients. These aircraft are not
approved for Technical Rescue air operations.
DPS helicopters are capable of carrying one patient only. DPS helicopter pilots must be advised of a
litter patient prior to taking off or landing so that the interior of the helicopter can be put in proper
configuration to accommodate the patient.
Helicopter medical transportation should be considered for -- Immediate trauma patients requiring
urgent surgery, patients requiring specialized treatment (OB, pediatric, burns, neurological.) or any
other patient Medical Control deems necessary.

AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE
Aerial observation may be desirable to assist Command in complex situations. This has proven
extremely effective in brush firefighting, complex structural fires involving difficult access, high-rise fires,
and for tracking direction and distance of air contamination at haz mat fires. Helicopters may be
requested to place a fire department observer overhead with communications to Command.
Helicopters belonging to television stations and other media aircraft have been requested to avoid
interference with ground operations. The same rules apply to landing in the incident area as apply to
any other helicopters.
News station helicopters may be requested to provide assistance at incidents. Most news station
helicopters have the capability to communicate on fire channels.
During major incidents, Command may request to have the surrounding airspace restricted to avoid
interference with emergency operations. The request must be made to the FAA Flight Service Station.
(Contact information is maintained in CAD file). News helicopters may or may not be restricted from
this space at the discretion of command. News helicopters are not approved for use in technical
rescue (SPECIAL USE) operations except as aerial observers.
TRANSPORTATION OF PERSONNEL AND/OR EQUIPMENT
Helicopters may be requested for transportation of personnel and/or equipment urgently needed at the
scene of an emergency, particularly when distance is a factor. The request for assistance should
include the number of personnel and the weight and volume of equipment to be transported.
Helicopters may also be used to transport personnel and equipment to the top of a high-rise building or
across difficult terrain for firefighting purposes. An appropriately sized landing zone should be identified
in close proximity to the staging area, with enough space and separation to provide for safe operations.
BRUSH FIREFIGHTING
Two methods of brush firefighting are available using helicopters. The Phoenix Police Air Unit has the
ability to put two Bambi Buckets in service and are available to respond to brush fires to provide aerial
water drop capability.
The Mesa Police Department has the ability to put one Bambi Bucket in service.
The Phoenix Fire Department currently has four buoy wall tanks. Mesa Fire Department has one buoy
wall. The buoy wall tanks will hold either 3,000 or 4,000 gallons of water.
The Bambi Buckets can hold from 67 to 96 gallons of water, depending on air temperature and humidity
and may be filled from a canal, buoy wall tank, or any other body of water that is available.
All drop instructions and reporting effectiveness of drops will be relayed to pilot by Command or an
individual designated by Command. All personnel will remain clear of the drop zone.
NOTE: Helicopters with full buckets are prohibited from flying over occupied structures or traffic.
Roadways must be closed or structures evacuated if no other flight path can be used.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

AIR OPERATONS
M.P. 201.07

09/01-R

Page 3 of 9

BUOY WALL SET UP
The engine company assigned to the landing zone sector will assist the water tender driver with set up
and filling the buoy wall tank. The buoy wall must be set up in a large flat area clear of overhead
obstruction. Place one or two salvage covers on the ground to protect the bottom of the tank. Buoy wall
tanks fill from the bottom only. Start filling the tank slowly after approximately one foot of water is in the
tank the flow rate can be increased. Foam concentrate can be added to the tank when it is about one
foot from the top.
NOTE: Apparatus must be kept at least 150' to the side of the flight path of helicopters dipping the tank.
CONTRACT HELICOPTER SERVICES
This service is provided by contract with the Phoenix Fire Department and involves an hourly charge for
service. These helicopters can drop approximately 120 gallons of water on each pass over the fire. The
drop can be directed on one spot or along a running pass.
One or more helicopters may be requested for the operation. Average flying time per fuel load is 1-1/2
to two hours and a refueling vehicle can be dispatched to the scene.
An engine company shall be assigned to control the landing zone. A supply line shall be laid from a
hydrant and two 1-1/2 inch lines shall be extended. Lines are to refill belly tanks, wet down area, and to
provide fire protection.
Crews will approach the helicopter only after making eye contact with the pilot and the pilot has to refill
and re-arm belly tank. All refilling is done from the right side of the aircraft.
Crews will approach and withdraw along the same path; to front of the aircraft within 45 degrees. When
the crew is clear and off to the sides, the landing zone officer will signal the pilot for take-off.
All drop instructions and reporting effectiveness of drops will be relayed to pilot by Command or an
individual designated by Command. All personnel will remain clear of the drop zone.
RESCUE
Helicopters are particularly suited for physical rescue of persons stranded in inaccessible locations.
Depending on the location of the victim, a helicopter may be useful in removing the victim or placing
rescue personnel in a position to reach the victim.
Technical Rescue Team personnel, along with proper helicopter agency, should be considered for
access to particularly difficult locations. The risk of using helicopters and placing rescue personnel in
dangerous situations must be weighed against the urgency of the rescue situation. These
considerations may be critical during hours of darkness or poor flying weather.
SPECIAL USE
“Special Use” of helicopters are activities that require pilots and rescuers to use certified technical
rescue skills to affect the rescue of a patient or patients that are in critical condition or life-threatening
situations. These are high-risk operations that can pose a serious threat to the life safety of both
patients and rescuers.

External load (slingloads, longlines, water bucket, etc.)
Hover sites (low-level hovering)
Helicopter rappelling (insertions and extraction’s)
Flights conducted below 500 feet above ground level (AGL)
Helicopter operations around a fire perimeter
Single skid landings
Any takeoff or landing requiring special pilot technique due to terrain, obstacles, or surface
condition.

Any “Special Use” of helicopters during rescue operations will require a Technical Rescue Sector to be
established by Command. It shall be the responsibility of the Technical Rescue Sector officer to
establish and coordinate the rescue plan with the appropriate pilots and Fire Command.
“Special Use” helicopter operations shall only be performed by certified City of Phoenix Police
Department pilots and Phoenix Fire Department Technical Rescue Technicians. Prior to initiating any
rescue operation that required the “Special Use” of a helicopter, a risk benefit analysis will be
completed by Technical Sector Officer (T.S.O), Phoenix PD pilot, and Command. The “Special Use”
operation will only continue if this analysis determines the patient to be in critical condition, or a lifethreatening situation exist for the patient(s) or rescuers.
HELICOPTER LOAD CALCULATION
Any “Special Use” of helicopters during rescue operations will require proper load calculations to be
completed. Prior to initiating a rescue the pilot will perform a power check. After landing, the pilot will
meet with the Technical Rescue Sector officer or a representative; together they will complete and sign
the helicopter load calculation form. The load calculation form will be required for both internal and
external loads.
The load calculation form will be retained by Technical Rescue Sector officer and submitted with the
T.R.T. rescue report.
The pilot will insure that proper loading procedures are followed. All helicopters will be flown within the
center-of-gravity envelope and gross weight limitations.
COMMUNICATIONS
Air-to-ground communications shall be used whenever possible to give landing instructions to
approaching helicopters. Dispatch will coordinate the establishment of air-to-ground communications.
The pilot of a helicopter approaching the scene will advise Dispatch when ready to communicate with
ground units. Dispatch will assign the radio channel to be used and advise Command of the identity of
the helicopter. Direct air-to-ground communications shall then be established between the helicopter
and Landing Zone personnel. Personnel in the landing area should have direct communications with
the pilot before landing.

Page 5 of 9

When helicopters are actively engaged in operations at the scene of an incident, Command should
assign all helicopter communications to a separate radio channel and designate a person to work
exclusively with this channel.
“Special Use” operations require a designated radio channel that is clear of any other traffic.
NOTE: National Guard helicopters have no direct communications capability with fire department
ground units. Landing instructions must be given by hand signals.
Helicopters will not land in the incident area without first making contact with ground units. If unable to
make contact on an assigned channel, the arriving helicopter shall circle or hover in the vicinity until
contact is established.
Helicopters may be directed to land via hand or light signals when radio communication proves
unfeasible. Landings shall not be made in proximity to the incident without positive contact (radios or
hand signals).
FIREBIRD
Firebird is the designation for a helicopter operating under the direction of the Phoenix Fire
Department. This includes Phoenix Police helicopters providing aerial reconnaissance, brush
firefighting operations, transportation, or special use operations.
The designations "Firebird 1,2,3" etc., will be used to identify different helicopters in use on any one
incident. Mesa Police Department helicopter designation is Falcon. Falcon 3 & 4 have the same
capabilities as Firebird.
Ranger 41
Ranger 41 is the designation for the helicopter operating under the direction of the Department of
Public Safety. This unit is staffed with 1 DPS officer/pilot, 1 DPS officer/paramedic, and 1 Phoenix Fire
paramedic. R-41 has capabilities for emergency medical transportation and aerial reconnaissance
transportation of manpower and equipment.
LANDING ZONES
The selection of an appropriate landing zone is of critical importance in all field situations. A suitable
landing area must be located and identified for the pilot. Should anything become unsafe during the
approach of any helicopter during landing operations instruct the pilot to GO AROUND three
times.
Command will assign personnel to select and identify a landing zone. The assigned personnel shall
have a portable radio, eye protection, ear protection, high-visibility safety vests. All personnel assigned
to the landing zone operation shall be on the designated landing zone radio frequency. Engine
companies are more suitable for this assignment.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

AIR OPERATONS
M.P. 201.07

Page 6 of 9

The landing zone must be relatively flat and free of obstructions for an area of at least 100' x 100' for
each helicopter. All spectators, vehicle traffic (including emergency vehicles) and animals must be kept
a minimum of 200' away from the landing zone. In the center of the landing zone, a 60' x 60' "touch
down" area shall be identified with appropriate visual markers. The individual communicating with the
pilot shall stand at the front right corner (as seen by the pilot) of the touch down area. A visual check
should be made for overhead wires, poles, towers, and similar obstructions. Any obstructions noted
must be communicated to the pilot before he/she is committed. The pilot can then assess the
obstruction.
“Special Use” landing zones are defined as any landing zone where the pilot cannot land and shut
down power to the aircraft. “Special Use” landing zones are technical by nature and shall be staffed by
members of the Technical Rescue Team at both the base and off-site landing zones.
The approach and departure paths (into the wind) must be free of obstructions. For heavily loaded
helicopters (i.e., water drop), the clear path should extend at least 100 yards in each direction.
Approach and departure paths should not pass over a treatment area, Command Post, or other activity
areas where noise and rotor wash will cause problems.
The landing zone should be located at least 100 yards from other activity areas.
The landing zone and surrounding area must be free of small objects which can be blown around by
rotor wash. Check for metal objects and secure loose clothing or blankets.
Avoid dusty locations if possible. If the landing area is dusty, wet down the area with a hose line before
landing.
Once a helicopter has landed the pilot may elect to shut down for added safety in the landing zone.
While the helicopter is on the ground, whether running or not, a "tail guard" shall be stationed 50 to 100
feet from the tail rotor to keep the area secured. At no time shall personnel pass behind the body of
the helicopter and the tail rotor.
Radio contact and the landing zone shall be maintained for two to three minutes after departure of the
helicopter in case an in-flight emergency is experienced and the helicopter needs to return to the
landing zone.
HELICOPTER SAFETY FACTORS
• Approach and depart helicopter from the front or 45 degrees from the front, in a crouching
position; remain in view of the pilot.
• Establish eye contact with pilot or observer before approaching if rotors are moving.
• Do not approach helicopter after landing until pilot or observer signals approval to approach
aircraft.
• Approach and depart in pilot's or observer's field of vision (never towards the tail rotor).
• At no time will personnel approach the tail area of any helicopter.
• Landing zone personnel shall use eye protection or helmet face shields and ear protection.
Helmet chinstraps shall be tightened securely.
• Use a chinstrap or secure hardhat when working around main rotor.

Keep landing areas clear of loose articles that may "fly" in the rotor down wash.
Provide wind indicators for take-off and landings; back to the wind, arms extended in front of
body.
Beware of rotor wash. Small objects and clothing (caps, jackets, etc.) can be blown around
easily. Do not grab or chase articles blown off by the rotor wash.
Be aware the spotlights used to illuminate obstructions can blind the pilot. Extreme caution
should be used. Only use spotlights to illuminate the bottom of poles. Do not shine upward.
Fasten seat belt upon entering helicopter and leave buckled until pilot signals to exit. Fasten
seat belt behind you before leaving.
Use the door latches as instructed; caution should be exercised around moving parts or
Plexiglas.
Do not throw items from the helicopter.
Carry tools horizontally and below waist level, never upright or over shoulder.
Secure items internally and externally on the helicopter.
Provide pilot with accurate weights and types of baggage.
Stage patients waiting to be loaded at least 150 feet away. Secure sheets and blankets and
cover eyes during landing.

PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE)
PPE consists of clothing and equipment that provide protection to an individual in a hazardous
environment.
All fire personnel and crew members will wear the following PPE when operating in or on the helicopter.
Flight Helmet: Must provide protection for the head.
Exceptions: TRT helmets or helicopter headsets may be used when a flight helmet is not necessary.
(Flight helmets must be worn during long-line operations.) Fire helmets may be used by brush
firefighters being transported to and from sites and firefighters in full protective clothing.
Fire Resistant Clothing: Nomex jumpsuit with length sufficient to eliminate exposure between boots
and gloves, or structural firefighting coat and pants.
Exception: Brush firefighters may wear FR pants and Nomex brush jacket.
Leather Boots: Should extend above ankle.
Exception: Working in an environment not conducive to wearing leather boots.
Gloves: Should be leather or Nomex and leather.

This procedure provides guidelines for conducting post incident reviews. Fire companies are usually
involved with several incidents each shift after which they could participate in a post incident review.
Participants will benefit most when a post incident review is conducted at the incident scene.
Information will be fresh in everyone's mind and the scene may help to reinforce learning. The Battalion
Chief or Company Officer can conduct a review after any incident.
Several areas will be identified for discussion in each review.

A new form has been developed to assist the BC in being thorough and consistent in the review. The
form should be completed by the Battalion Chief and forwarded to the Tactical Services Section for
review, reporting, and training. The reverse side of the Tactical Worksheet and other review check
sheets are good tools to use in assisting a review of any incident. Use visual references of the scene
whenever possible.
The purpose of the safety component of this review is to emphasize firefighter safety by reinforcing
safety behaviors, assess the current level of safety (measure how we're doing), and identify areas
where safety improvement can be made.
The focus of the review should be on the overall operation, firefighter safety and survival, and customer
service. Reinforce all safety behaviors. In doing so, remember that individual successes should not
outweigh the safety of the overall operation or crews.
The Post Incident Review should be concluded on a positive note. Single company reviews which are
conducted by Captains after an incident or training exercise can be used to chart a company's
improvement. In areas such as safety, the review may assist in focusing on areas a company may need
to improve. Included in this procedure are check sheets to be used as tools in evaluating operational
safety.

Operational Information
In Level 1 Staging situations, first arriving Engine, Ladder or Heavy Rescue, and Rescue
companies will perform these functions as required and ordered by Command.
Company Officers will determine based upon conditions and the Risk Management Plan, the
priority of the functions for their company unless otherwise ordered by Command. This does
not limit a company to only its listed functions. Every company will be expected to perform all
basic functions safely within the limits of their capability, and it will be the on‐going
responsibility of Command to integrate tasks and functions as required with the on‐scene units.

In the absence (or delay) of Ladder company response, Command should assign ladder
functions to a Heavy Rescue or an Engine company. For example, Command may assign an
Engine company to perform salvage or overhaul. The assignment of these basic operations
represents a standard fireground plan for task and tactical operations designed to improve the
effectiveness and safety of all units working together. This plan should in no way limit the
initiative of any officer and should enhance the decision‐making process of all officers by
establishing a standard operational framework.

Fireground Factors

M.P. 202.02

01/18

Page 1 of 6

Fireground factors offer a standard list that the Incident Commander must consider in the
evaluation of an incident. Critical Fireground Factors are determined through deliberate and
focused size‐up with intent of evaluating the incident to determine how and to what extent the
tactical objectives will be met for any particular incident.
Operational Information
The establishment of the Critical Fireground Factors for any incident is done through the
standard process of size‐up. Size‐up is defined as: “an appraisal of the magnitude or dimensions
of an event or incident”.
The Critical Fireground Factors are meant to be used as a tool to assist the Incident Commander
with simplifying complex information into 7 distinct categories. They are meant to provide the
Incident Commander the ability to categorize and simply communicate what is critical within a
specific incident. Not all factors are typically critical for every incident. The ability of the
incident commander to identify what size‐up information is truly critical to the accomplishment
of the tactical objectives is very important. It is equally important for the Incident Commander
to set aside or disqualify factors that are not directly important to the incident outcome.
It is unacceptable to begin operations before adequately performing size‐up and considering
the critical fireground factors. A fire attack is many times an instinctive action‐oriented process
that involves taking the shortest and quickest route directly to the fire. Action feels good in
fireground situations while it can be perceived that thinking delays action. Beware of non‐
thinking attack situations and non‐thinking attackers, they are dangerous and unacceptable.
Fireground factors represent an array of items that are dynamic during the entire fireground
process. The relative importance of each factor changes throughout that time frame. Command
must continually deal with these changes and base decisions on fireground factor information
that is timely and current. Beware of developing an incident action plan and sticking to that
same plan throughout the fire, even though conditions continue to change. Effective fire
operations require action plan revisions that continually reconsider fireground factors based
upon information feedback.
In critical fire situations, Command may develop an incident action plan and initiate an attack
based on incomplete information compiled in an initial size‐up. This may leave the Incident

PHOENIX REGIONAL

Commander with significant questions regarding the incident structure, conditions and/or
occupancy. This is defined as critical unknown information. In such cases, efforts must continue
throughout the operation to improve the information on which those decisions are based.
Command will seldom operate with complete information during initial operations.
The effective management of each fireground factor requires Command to apply all methods of
information gathering and communication (i.e., visual, recon, preplan) to each factor. This is
particularly true between the major categories of fireground factors. Command must deal with
each factor in the most effective manner.
Most incident situations represent a complex problem regarding how Command deals with
fireground factor information. There are factors that can be determined from a Command
position on the outside of the structure and other factors that can only be determined from
other operating positions, both outside and inside the structure. During an incident, fireground
factor information is gathered utilizing one or more of the following overlapping forms of size
up:
1. Visual: Fireground factors which are obvious to visual observation and those absorbed
subconsciously. This visual information is categorized as the type that can normally be
gained by actually looking at a tactical situation from the outside. This form of
intelligence involves the perceptive capability of Command.
2. Reconnaissance: Fireground information that is not visually available to Command from
a position on the outside of a tactical situation and must be gained by actually sending
someone to check‐out, go‐see, look‐up, research, advise, call, go‐find, etc. This generally
involves Command making a specific assignment for the coordination and completion of
a 360° recon and then receiving an information‐oriented report.
3. Preplanning and Familiarity: Intelligence that is gained from formal pre‐fire planning,
general informal familiarization activities and from C.A.D. through the M.D.T. (e.g., bldg.
drawings, hazardous materials, etc.). Such intelligence increases the information
initially available to Command from the OUTSIDE of a tactical situation. This information
provides Command with intelligence that would otherwise have to come from a
Reconnaissance report or might not be available.
The following are fireground factors which should be evaluated by Command as they pertain to
each tactical situation. They can be obtained by using the above information management
factors.

Tactical Objectives

M.P. 202.02A

01/18

Page 1 of 2

Tactical Objectives identify the three separate and critical events that must be completed to
stabilize any incident.
These objectives though separate are interrelated activities which must be dealt with
concurrently. Completion and priority of the objectives is directly correlated to the size up, risk
management and conditions of the incident.
The tactical objectives are as follows:
1. Rescue
2. Fire Control
3. Property Conservation
Rescue ‐ The activities required to protect occupants, remove those who are threatened and to
treat the injured.
Fire Control ‐ The activities required to stop the forward progress of the fire and to bring the
fire under control.
Property Conservation ‐ The activities required to stop or reduce primary or secondary damage
to property.
When each tactical objective is reached the following benchmarks of completion are
announced
Tactical objective
Rescue/ primary search
Fire Control
Property Conservation

Announce Benchmark
‐ All clear
‐ Under control
‐ Loss stopped

All three tactical objectives require somewhat different tactical approaches from a Command
and an operational standpoint.
While Command must satisfy each tactical objective they often occur simultaneously. Notable
examples are the frequent need to achieve interior tenability with active/extensive fire control
efforts before proceeding with primary search, or the need to initiate property conservation
activities while active fire control efforts are being extended.

The tactical objectives, (Rescue, Fire Control, Property Conservation) are clear, measurable, and
obtainable objectives. Completion and priority of the objectives is directly correlated to the size
up, risk management and conditions of the incident.
Within the Command framework lies an on‐going responsibility that is not completed with
benchmarks. This is often referred to as the umbrella of service. The umbrella of service is
made up of three on‐going considerations. They are fire fighter safety, customer service, and
loss control.
Customer Service

Fireground Strategy

M.P. 202.02B

01/18

Page 1 of 7

Procedure
Structural fireground operations will fall in one of two strategies, Offensive or Defensive.
Fireground strategy is determined and declared by the Incident Commander on all structure fire
incidents. The Incident Command constantly reevaluates the fireground strategy, driven by size
up and risk management.
The Offensive or Defensive strategies are based on the application of the Risk Management
Plan.
1. We Will risk our lives a lot, in a calculated manner, to save SAVABLE lives.
2. We Will risk our lives a Little, in a calculated manner, to save SAVABLE property.
3. We Will Not risk our lives at all for lives or property that are already Lost.
Considering the level of risk, the Incident Commander will choose the proper strategy to be
used at the fire scene.
The strategy can change with conditions or because certain benchmarks (i.e., ALL CLEAR) are
obtained.
The fireground strategy is also based on a reevaluation of the incident size‐up, all Fireground
Factors and reconsideration of risk.

Once the appropriate strategy is initiated, it becomes the Incident Commander's job to ensure

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Fireground Strategy

M.P. 202.02B

01/18

Page 2 of 7

that all personnel are operating within the correct strategy. By controlling the fireground
strategy, the Incident Commander is providing overall incident scene safety. The proper
strategy will be maintained by the following actions:




Avoiding simultaneous OFFENSIVE and DEFENSIVE strategies in the same fire area. This
typically happens by first committing personnel to interior positions, then operating
master streams from exterior positions, which places interior crews in danger of injury
or death.
Matching the appropriate strategy to the fire conditions of the structure and minimizing
risk to fire fighters.

Managing fireground strategy must start with the arrival of the first unit and be constantly
monitored and evaluated throughout the entire incident. The initial Incident Commander will
include the fireground strategy in the on‐scene report. As Command is transferred to later
arriving officers, these officers assuming Command must reevaluate the fireground strategy
based on the Risk Management Plan.
Fireground strategy provides a starting point for fireground operations. Once the strategy is
announced, all firefighters know whether to operate on the interior or exterior of the building.
The fireground strategy cannot be a mystery, everyone operating on the fireground must be
operating in the same strategy mode (Offensive or Defensive).
Offensive Strategy

Commercial and residential fires require a thorough size up, assessment of life safety, and
consideration of the Risk Management Plan. Once it is determined that an offensive attack is
safe and appropriate, a smart and deliberate execution of the tactical objectives will be

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

conducted. The following are guidelines for offensive fire attacks once size up has been
completed and offensive strategy has been determined:
1. Assume Command
2. Address 2 in / 2 out decision prior to entry.

3. Initial attack efforts must be directed toward supporting a primary search. This may
require rescuers to go to obvious victims or to manage the hazard and extinguish the
fire. The first attack line must go where it can best affect this mission and its placement
is dependent upon the variables present on the fireground, determine fire conditions
and extent before starting fire operations (as far as possible). Gather 360° of
information; identify the flow path and the most likely location of the fire and survivable
environments for victims. Search, rescue and fire attack are simultaneous operations.
4. Offensive fires should be fought aggressively, with rapid and effective size up. Quickly
identify conditions in the occupancy and apply the quickest, most appropriate, water to
the fire.
5. Keep the building openings closed if possible to reduce ventilation of the fire until you
have a charged hose line in place and are prepared to make entry.
6. *Before making entry* When possible reset or darken down the fire using a straight
stream applied to the ceiling of the fire compartment. 15‐30 seconds of water applied in
this manner will dramatically reduce temperatures and improve tenability throughout
the occupancy. This tactic must be followed by an aggressive interior attack to complete
fire extinguishment and evacuate any victims.
7. Make every effort to enter the structure at the air intake side of the flow path. You want
the air at your back as you make entry. This will reduce the likelihood of being caught in
the flow path.
8. Co‐ordinate all ventilation of the structure to ensure effectiveness and improvement of
interior conditions.

Companies must maintain situational awareness and resist the urge to focus only on the fire
(this is known as the "candle moth" syndrome or "tunnel vision"). In some cases, the most
effective tactical analysis involves an evaluation of what is not burning rather than what is
actually on fire. The unburned portion represents where the fire is going and should establish
the framework for fire control activities and requirements.
Command must consider the most critical direction and avenues of fire extension, plus its
speed, particularly as they affect:





Rescue activities
Level of risk to firefighters
Confinement efforts
Exposure protection

Command must allocate personnel and resources based upon this fire extension/spread
evaluation.
Command must not lose sight of the very simple and basic fireground reality that at some point
firefighters must engage and fight the fire. Command must structure whatever operations are
required to put water on the fire. The rescue/fire control‐extension/exposure problem is solved
in most cases by a fast, strong, well‐placed attack. Command must establish an attack plan that
overpowers the fire with actual water application, either from offensive or defensive positions.
Command must consider the seven sides (or sectors) of the fire: front, rear, both sides, top,
bottom, and interior. Fires cannot be considered under control until all seven sides are
addressed. Failure to address all seven sides will frequently result in fire extension.
Where the fire involves concealed spaces (attics, ceiling areas, construction voids, etc.), it
becomes paramount that companies identify and operate fire streams into such areas. Early
identification and response to concealed space fires will save the building. Officers who hesitate
to gain access to concealed spaces because they don't want to beat up the building may lose
the entire structure.
Early coordinated ventilation is a major support item that must be addressed during concealed
space attacks. Ventilation must be initiated early and be well coordinated with interior crews.
Ventilation openings should be made in the fire area.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Fireground Strategy

M.P. 202.02B

01/18

Page 5 of 7

Command must “get ahead” of the fire. Command must make critical decisions that relate to
cutoff points and develop a pessimistic fire control strategy. It takes a certain amount of time to
get water to a location, and the fire continues to burn while the attack is being set up.
Command must consider where the fire will be when attack efforts are ready to go into
operation; if misjudged, the fire may burn past the attack/cutoff position before resources and
personnel are in position. Do not play "catch up" with a fire that is burning through a building.
Project your set‐up time, write off property and get ahead of the fire. Set up adequately ahead
of the fire, then overpower it.
Write‐off property that is already lost and go on to protect exposed property based on the most
dangerous direction of fire spread. Do not continue to operate in positions that are essentially
lost.
The basic variables relating to attack operations involve:




Location/position of attack
Size of attack
Support functions

Command develops an effective attack through the management of these factors. Command
must balance and integrate attack size and position with fire conditions, risk and resources.
Many times, offensive/defensive conditions are clear cut and Command can quickly determine
the appropriate strategy. In other cases, the conditions are Marginal, and Command must
clearly communicate these conditions.
A Marginal situation is defined as defensive conditions with a known rescue
A Marginal situation has a very short window to affect a rescue or to discontinue the attempt
and begin a defensive fire attack.
Strategy changes can develop almost instantly or can take considerable time. Command must
match the strategy with the conditions. The Incident Commander controls overall incident
scene safety by determining the proper strategy and subsequently the proper tactics to be
used.

Fireground Strategy

Page 6 of 7

If the Incident Commander doesn't change strategies from offensive to defensive until the
building is disassembling itself due to structural damage, Command is late in strategy
determination and on the receiving end of the building's decision governing the new strategy to
be employed. Often times when the building gets to make those decisions, fire fighters become
traumatized (physically and/or emotionally). The Incident Commander determines the strategy,
the building should not.
Command needs to constantly evaluate conditions while operating in marginal situations. This
requires frequent and detailed reports from Sector Officers.
It is imperative that Command assign a Roof Sector as early as possible during marginal
situations for rapid evaluation of roof conditions. In certain situations, Command should
strongly consider not committing crews to the interior of a structure unless he/she receives a
report from Roof Sector that the roof of the structure is safe to operate on and under. It is
better to go from an offensive to a defensive strategy too soon rather than too late.
Defensive Strategy
The decision to operate in a defensive strategy indicates that the offensive attack strategy, or
the potential for one, has been abandoned. The elements of an effective defensive strategy
always include:




Identify what is lost
Write it off
Protect exposures

The announcement of a change to a defensive strategy will be made as Emergency Traffic and
all personnel will withdraw from the structure and maintain a safe distance from the building.
Captains will account for their crews and advise their Sector Officer on the status of their crew.
Sector Officers will notify Command of the status of the crews assigned to their sector. A PAR
(Personnel Accountability Report) shall be obtained after any switch from offensive to
defensive strategy.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Fireground Strategy

M.P. 202.02B

01/18

Page 7 of 7

Interior lines will be withdrawn and repositioned when changing to a defensive strategy. Crews
should retreat with their hose lines if safe to do so. If retreat is being delayed because of hose
lines, and it is unsafe to stay in the building, hose lines should be abandoned.
All exposures, both immediate and anticipated, must be identified and protected. The ability to
protect these exposures from any appropriate position must be assessed and coordinated. This
must match the overall strategic level incident size‐up and position in the risk management
plan.
An attempt to control the main body of fire is critical. This may be the best thing to assist in
protection of exposures.
Master streams are generally the most effective tactic to be employed in defensive operations.
For tactical purposes, a standard master stream flow of at least 750 GPM should be the
guideline. Adjustments may be made upward or downward from this figure, but it is very
significant in the initial deployment of master streams.
When the exposure is severe, and water is limited, the most effective tactic is to put water on
the exposure. Once exposure protection is established, attention may be directed to knocking
down the main body of fire and thermal column cooling. The same principles of large volume
water application should be employed.
“FIRE UNDER CONTROL” means the forward progress of the fire has been stopped and the
remaining fire can be extinguished with the on‐scene resources; it does not mean the fire is
completely out. When the fire is brought under control, Command will notify Alarm utilizing the
standard radio report of "FIRE UNDER CONTROL" and alarm will record the time of this report.
Command must initiate a PAR report from all sectors and crews.
If defensive operations are conducted from the onset of the incident, Command will notify
Alarm that there will not be a primary search completed for the affected structure(s).

Review Date: 03/2026

Life safety is the highest tactical priority on the fireground and in all other hazard zones. The
primary focus of hazard zone operations is to size up an incident to assess for the presence or
likelihood of savable lives and build a plan to execute the rescue of victims. There are many
potential actions that can best facilitate the successful rescue and/or removal of victims and are
dependent on conditions and resources.
The two elements that are of greatest threat to fire victims are toxic and thermal exposure. Toxic
exposure to the products of combustion is less about the proximity to the fire and directly
impacted by the volume and movement of the smoke and gases in the interior of the structure.
The degree of which victim(s) are exposed to toxic smoke is directly related to their elevation and
location in the building. Since heat and smoke rises and travels throughout the building, victims
in elevated locations are at a higher risk. Exceptions exist, like for instance a closed interior door
that protects the victims from the smoke and heat.
Thermal exposure is directly related to the proximity to the fire and the elevation a victim is in the
interior. Victims located near to or in the flow path inside the structure are at significantly more
risk as well. The closer a victim is and the higher they are in the interior space, the greater the total
exposure and danger. Barriers, such as closed doors and furniture, can provide some protection
from thermal exposure to trapped victims inside of a structure.
We initiate every fire response with the expectation that we will encounter fire and smoke
conditions that are endangering the occupants. An effective size up, utilizing all forms of
information gathering available, is critical. Exterior fire and smoke conditions can give clues to the
most endangered spaces but is not always reliable as to the extent and threat level to the victims.
A size-up from the interior is necessary to assess the immediate conditions potentially impacting
victims and may be very different from the exterior perspective. It is critical to assess the most
RESCUE
Page 1 of 5

effective action on the fireground to improve the tenability of victims prior to rescue. Sometimes
this action involves an effective fire attack from the most advantageous position (interior or
exterior) to improve the conditions. Other times it may involve immediately working to remove
victims utilizing the path of safest removal. Removing the victims from the fire or removing the
fire/heat/smoke from the victims is a critical decision at all active fire incidents where savable lives
exist.
PROCEDURE
The Incident Commander (IC) shall direct fireground efforts to protect savable lives. For example,
on residential fires, the IC shall direct a primary search in all involved and exposed occupancies
when aligned with the risk management profile. When appropriate at non-residential fires, the IC
should take steps to facilitate and support evacuation of the fire occupancy as well as exposures.
The IC should determine the most effective action utilizing the limited initial resources to best
impact victim rescue. The initial action may be an exterior or interior fire attack coupled with
immediate rescue actions. The Incident Commander must structure initial operations around the
completion of the primary search.
The Incident Commander must consider the following factors in developing a basic rescue sizeup:
• Number, location, and condition of victims.
• Fire conditions and the impact it has on the victims.
• What actions best impact the survivability and/or tenability of the victims?
• What actions best impact our ability to search the structure?
• Can firefighters access the victims?
• How are they going to be removed from the structure?
Note: The IC should ensure a 360 is completed on all incidents to assess the factors above.
Command must make the basic rescue decision:
• Do we remove the victims from the fire? OR
• Do we remove the fire from the victims?
• Do the conditions and resources allow for simultaneous action?
Rescue efforts should be extended in the following order:
• Most severely threatened
• The largest number (groups)
• The remainder of the fire area
• The exposed areas

A primary search means companies have quickly gone through all affected areas and verified the
removal and/or safety of all occupants. Time is the critical factor in the primary search process.
Successful primary search operations must be extended as quickly as possible dependent on the
conditions and fire suppression actions. The completion of the primary search is reported utilizing
the standard radio reporting term "All Clear."
It is the responsibility of Command to coordinate primary search assignments and secure
completion reports from interior companies. The tactical benchmark for completing a primary
search is “All Clear.” Alarm will record the time of the “All Clear” report from Command.
The rescue functions that follow fire control activities or completed after a primary search is
completed will be regarded as a secondary search. A secondary search means that companies
thoroughly search the interior of the fire area after initial fire control and ventilation activities have
been completed. A secondary search should preferably be completed by different companies than
those involved in the primary search activities. Thoroughness, rather than time, is the critical factor
in a secondary search.
The objective of a secondary search is the confirmation of an “All Clear.” This should be reported
to the Alarm Room upon completion.
OPERATIONAL INFORMATION
The stage of the fire becomes a critical factor that affects the rescue plan developed by Command.
On residential fire incidents, the following items outline the basic Command approach to fire
stages:
•

•

•

In nothing showing situations, or in very minor fire cases that clearly pose no life hazard,
Command must structure a rapid interior search and report "ALL CLEAR." The interior
search for victims will also include an interior size up for smoke or fire conditions.
In smoke showing and working fire situations, fire control efforts must be extended
simultaneously with rescue operations to gain entry and control interior access to complete
a primary search. In such cases, Command and operating companies must be aware that
this action is working with greatest allowable risk and is focused on the location and
removal of victims. Fire knockdown or control may be a critical factor in completing a
primary search. In working fire situations, a primary search must be followed by a
secondary search.
In cases of fully involved buildings or compartments of buildings, a fire attack with
adequate water flow becomes the primary focus. A size up must be conducted to determine
the ability to search exposed or connected areas if the conditions and building integrity
allow. This must be coordinated with the fire attack plan. Clear communications and
determination of what areas can be searched in conjunction with fire control and
coordinated ventilation is critical. Command must determine which areas will not be
RESCUE
Page 3 of 5

searched due to fire conditions and structural integrity. As quickly as fire control is
achieved, Command must structure what is, in effect, a secondary search for victims.
Command and operating companies cannot depend solely upon reports from residents and
spectators to determine status of victims. Fire companies should utilize reports as to the location,
number, and condition of victims as supporting primary search efforts, and must extend and
complete a primary search wherever entry is possible. Search and rescue operations are condition
and structure dependent.
In some cases, protecting exposed occupants in a safe location inside the structure is the most
appropriate action. These occupants are safer in their rooms than moving through contaminated
hallways and interior areas. Such movement may also impede interior firefighting. When these
actions are appropriate, this must be communicated to the Sector Officer or Command depending
on the size and complexity of the incident.
Command must make specific primary search assignments to companies to cover specific areas
of large or complex residential occupancies (e.g., high-rise, mid-rise, large care homes, etc.) and
maintain on-going control of such companies until the entire area is searched when conditions
allow. When primary search companies encounter and remove victims, Command must assign
other companies to continue to cover the interior positions vacated by those companies.
All initial attack efforts must be directed toward supporting rescue efforts and hose lines must be
placed in a manner to control interior access, confine the fire, and protect avenues of escape.
Hoseline placement and adequate water flows become critical factors in these cases. Command,
Sector Officers, and all operating companies must realize that the operation is still focused on the
rescue of occupants in coordination with an effective fire attack.
Normal means of interior access (e.g., stairs, halls, interior public areas, etc.) should be utilized to
remove victims whenever possible. Secondary means of rescue (e.g., aerial platforms and ladders,
ground ladders, fire escapes, helicopters, etc.) must be utilized in their order of effectiveness.
Command must realistically evaluate the resources required to remove victims and then treat their
fire-affected bodies. In cases involving such multiple victims, Command must call for the timely
response of adequate resources and quickly develop an organization that will both stabilize the
fire and provide for the removal and treatment of the occupants. Command must structure
treatment of victims after removal. Multiple victims should be removed to one location for more
effective triage and treatment. Command should coordinate treatment and assign treatment
companies as required to a Treatment Sector.
Once the primary search has been completed and an "ALL CLEAR" transmitted, Command must
maintain control of access to the fire area; beware of occupants (and others) re-entering the
RESCUE
Page 4 of 5

building. The most urgent reason for calling additional alarms is for the purpose of effectively
managing the life safety potential. Command must develop a realistic (and pessimistic) rescue
size-up as early as possible.
The term "SEARCH & RESCUE" should be used when assigning companies to a primary search
over the radio; "ALL CLEAR" should be used only as a completion report.

Review Date: 12/2028

PROCEDURE
It is the standard operating procedure to stabilize fire conditions by an aggressive, well-placed fire
attack. Any initial attack must attempt to overwhelm fire conditions with well-placed water
application and suppression efforts from the most advantageous position(s) to include interior,
exterior, or a transitional attack. A transitional attack should be considered when you are passing
fire to fight fire and/or conditions need to be changed from the exterior prior to making entry. The
fire attack must utilize adequate water volume (gpm) for the fire conditions, heat release rate, and
structure/compartment size to control the fire, protect victims and/or property, as well as prevent
extension into exposed structures.
PRINCIPALS OF FIRE ATTACK
The most fundamental job of the Phoenix Regional Fire Departments is implementing an effective
fire attack. Size up, risk management, and rescue profile drive the strategy, ultimately deciding the
best tactics for fire attack. It is necessary to determine the complexity of the compartments, flow
path, and exposures when gauging possible fire attacks. Knowledge and understanding of fire
behavior and water application are necessary to mitigate the hazard, impact savable
lives/property, and remain as safe as possible.
RESIDENTIAL FIRES
By definition, this procedure considers residential fires to be any structures that our community
typically resides. This includes mobile homes, houses, multi-family residences, apartments (low-,
mid-, or high-rise occupancies), and any buildings that are lived in. These can range from small
structures to large multi-story buildings. Firefighting in these structures should be done with a
thorough size-up of life safety potential.
Fire control is a crucial component of improving the possibility of savable lives on the fireground.
When possible, search and rescue efforts should be performed simultaneously with fire attack to
allow for the best outcomes. Effective fire control also directly impacts the possibility of savable
property. Simply put, extinguishing the fire makes everything better on the fireground.
FIRE CONTROL
Page 1 of 9

Effective fire suppression techniques include understanding the principles of fire behavior. In
order to execute fire control, it must be understood what actions best extinguish interior fires.
Interior surface cooling with water, then followed by water application to the burning
fuels/contents is the most effective extinguishing tactic. This directly impacts interior spaces and
tenability for victims and firefighters. An effective fire attack requires appropriate water volume to
overwhelm and control the fire. The fire area's size and/or volume must be part of a thorough size
up in determining appropriate water volumes as a part of a well-supported fire attack. The ability
to get water flow to the best possible locations, from either the interior or the exterior, requires
effective hose line deployment with hose lines of adequate length and size for the desired water
flow. Utilizing the transitional attack involves water application from the exterior to change
conditions prior to making an interior attack. Size up of the fire structure and the distances and
items that are challenging the ease and direction of attack lines is a critical function of Company
Officers directing the fire attack.
When ventilation limited conditions are discovered during size up, an interior fire attack is typically
the best option. When interior fire attack is the best option, suppression efforts directed through
the inlet of interior flow paths are the most advantageous. The use of water volume, effective hose
stream patterns, and nozzle manipulation are critical to cooling the immediate environment for
firefighters advancing on the fire and increasing the pressures to change the flow path direction
away from firefighters. Fire attack and coordinated ventilation provide greater survivability,
firefighter safety, and property conservation. Intelligent fire attack techniques and coordinated
ventilation are essential to effective operations.
When there is a fire in an unventilated compartment, coordinated ventilation in the fire
compartment simultaneous to the fire attack will exhaust the super-heated fire gasses and smoke
ahead of the advancing attack crew. Ultimately, this tactic changes the flow path direction by
over-pressurizing the pathway firefighters are using to make their attack and pushing it back to
the fire compartment and out of the exhaust point. A fire attack against the flow path, without
the ability to manage the ventilation, is a tactic and should only occur out of necessity.
Understanding air movement and interior pressures should be evaluated and identified as a part
of a size up prior to effective fire attack tactics. This recognition and understanding allows for more
efficient fire suppression as well as improving interior survivability. Fire suppression from the
most advantageous position (interior or exterior) can significantly impact the thermal insult,
pressures, and flow path inside a fire building. Cooling the interior conditions reduces pressures
and may create favorable conditions for supplemental fire attack and interior search efforts.
Fire control is best supported with coordinated ventilation that is well planned and communicated
utilizing fire behavior principles. This can be accomplished in multiple ways, including vertical and
horizontal methods. Uncoordinated ventilation will make fire control more difficult, increasing
both toxic gasses and thermal insult; this is dangerous and decreases tenability for potential

during fire attack operations.

COMMERCIAL FIRES
By definition, this procedure considers commercial buildings to be any structures that our
community typically conducts business, manufacturing, storage, or typically non-residential in
nature. These can be varying in size and complexity. Commercial buildings can be free-standing,
part of or connected to other occupancies, and can be multi-story above and/or below grade. They
can contain large volumes of contents and include hazardous materials or processes. They can be
less compartmentalized than residential structures and have larger overall spaces. Commercial
occupancies in the Phoenix regional area can exceed 1 million square feet in space. Residential
fire tactics and flow rates should not be used in commercial fires, and NFPA 1710 target flows
should be the minimum.
Commercial building fires can have a life safety potential when experiencing fire conditions. The
greatest difference between commercial and residential life safety is firefighters' ability to impact
that life safety problem. Residential occupancies can allow for more effective search operations
due to the confined nature and fire area volumes. Search operations in large open areas, large
complex interior arrangements, or industrial settings with severe or worsening fire and smoke
conditions are ineffective and dangerous. As in any structure, the best thing we can do for any
potential victims is to extinguish the fire when possible. In cases of a known rescue, a targeted
search is possible with a thorough understanding of the fire and smoke conditions and a legitimate
assessment of the position in the risk management plan.
Commercial fires require an understanding of fire behavior as well. Commercial fires are more
complex, involve large areas and large content loads that can produce intense, severe fire
conditions. The best opportunity to extinguish commercial fires is to catch them at their smallest
FIRE CONTROL
Page 3 of 9

state after arrival with a well-executed fire attack that overwhelms the fire conditions. When
present, building fire suppression systems should be supported as early as possible as well. Water
volume and aggressive exposure protection are critical. Exposure protection may require interior
and roof positions or exterior operations depending on the building's conditions and structural
integrity.
All resources should be directed to fire attack operations from the onset unless a known rescue is
present. In this case, crews assigned to rescue must reassess the fire conditions, structural
stability, re-evaluate their risk management plan and communicate the necessary support actions.
Sector Officers and/or the IC must be able to support the fire attack operations and manage the
strategic level risk management plan to determine the duration of time it is possible for this rescue
to occur.
When working in the offensive strategy, the Company Officer should consider the need to attack
the fire with large volume handlines capable of flowing a minimum of 250 GPM from the most
advantageous positions. NFPA 1710 standard is a minimum of three hand lines with an overall
volume of 500 GPM or greater. Water application may be done from an exterior position utilizing
a transitional attack to improve conditions prior to entry. When conditions, or forecasted
conditions, prohibit safe and effective interior fire suppression the strategy should be changed to
defensive.
Water application may be done from interior positions as conditions and risk management allow
an offensive strategy or may be conducted from the exterior in an attempt to gain control of the
conditions or change to a defensive strategy. The fire attack's position and effort will determine
the most appropriate method to deploy 250+ GPM from the necessary tactical positions. Company
Officers and/or Sector Officers' responsibility is to direct the attack to determine the most
appropriate methods to engage a commercial fire.
Regardless of the strategy, a deliberate volume of water must be used to attempt to overwhelm
the fire and heat conditions.
Fire control in commercial fires is best supported with coordinated ventilation that is well planned
and communicated utilizing fire behavior principles. The greatest challenges for ventilation in
commercial fires are the buildings' size, the ability to create ventilation that is effective in
supporting the fire attack, and interior conditions. It is necessary to consider the size of ventilation
exhaust points to effectively improve interior conditions. This requires a size up of natural
openings and the opportunity to create openings for horizontal or vertical ventilation. The use of
windows and doors may provide better ventilation in coordination with fire attack than vertical
ventilation. The greatest challenge with vertical ventilation is the ability to create a large enough
opening in comparison to the building volume to provide adequate ventilation. It may be
impossible to cut a ventilation hole large enough to adequately exhaust interior heat and smoke.
The IC must work with Sector Officers to determine the potential and available options to ventilate

FIRE CONTROL

fires in commercial buildings. The intent of this coordination is to prevent rapid fire growth with
fire companies inside the building.
150 FOOT RULE

The simple expectation is that no fire companies should operate on the interior of any
structure, during firefighting operations, beyond their ability to retreat to an area of safe refuge
prior to their low air alarm going off.
During the recovery after the LODD of Firefighter Brett Tarver, the Phoenix Fire Department
established that the maximum distance any company should advance and operate inside of a
structure with smoke and fire conditions is 150 feet. This was determined by the standard lengths
of our attack lines and the capacity of SCBA air to allow ingress, working time, and egress without
the low air alarm sounding/vibrating.
There are variables that can limit the reasonable maximum distance fire companies should
operate inside a structure. These include smoke and fire conditions, building construction or
layout, occupancy type, interior obstacles, and the overall physical effort required to advance into
a building that increases the air consumption rate.
For the purposes of mid-rise and high-rise buildings, the 150-foot rule is defined as the maximum
distance any company should operate on the interior of any structure from the exterior entrance
or other protected interior access points. This is measured from any area of safe refuge to the end
of the hoseline length stretched into the building. In instances where fire crews are entering a
structure from the exterior doors without protect areas of refuge, the 150’ is measured from that
door. Areas of safe refuge are considered stair wells, stair landings, or any area that can be
protected by doors and potentially pressurized to keep smoke and fire out. These include
structures that have standpipes in the stairwells that are designed for the connection of fire hoses
that can be protected with doors and means of managing the interior environment.
FIRE ATTACK FROM STANDPIPES
As the City of Phoenix grows, there has been and will continue to be an increase in buildings with
large square footages and multi-story construction requiring an understanding of building
suppression systems. In addition, firefighting personnel must have an understanding of the types
of firefighting equipment necessary to ensure an effective fire attack from standpipes. These
include commercial and residential occupancies, from 1 story to 40+ stories. Standpipe firefighting
has multifaceted considerations based on the presence of building systems as well as the size,
layout, and complexity of the structures. Critical keys to consider when initiating a fire attack from
a standpipe include:
•

Ability to provide adequate water supply either utilizing building systems or engine
company pumps

FIRE CONTROL
Page 5 of 9

•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Ability to provide high pump discharge pressures to adequately take over for
malfunctioning or inadequate building fire pumps (Tandem pumping and high-pressure
supply hose should be considered).
Ability to provide adequate water pressure, depending on the hose and nozzle used, to
the highest/farthest standpipe outlet.
Ability to provide fire department external shut off at standpipe connections.
Ability to determine adequate flow at the nozzle.
Ability to flow NFPA 13E and 1710 recommended GPM for initial and subsequent fire
attack from standpipe connections.
Ability to flow NFPA 1710 recommended GPM from standpipes on multiple floors
simultaneously.
Knowledge and understanding of pressure reducing and pressure restricting appliances
as a part of standpipe systems and their limiting factors for firefighting.
Ability to stretch hose lines from standpipe connections to the fire location that can be
limited by smoke and heat conditions in stairwells and common hallways.

FIRE ATTACK EQUIPMENT AND STANDARDS
The Phoenix Fire Department has a flexible set of hose and nozzle packages to execute an effective
fire attack. Each has a specific range of effectiveness to cover the broad potential of residential
and commercial fires. It is the expected standard that Firefighters are proficient with these tools
and in understanding their capabilities. It is expected that Company Officers and Sector Officers
can determine the most effective fire attack operations and supervise their deployment and
operations. It is expected that Incident Commanders can determine the overall fire attack
requirements for the incident in its entirety and provide direction and leadership to tactical
positions as to the overall incident action plan and specifically fire attack for the given incident.
The current standards for water volume for fire attack and the specific hose and nozzle
combinations currently carried by Phoenix Fire Engine Companies are:
• Standard water flows from hose lines and appliances
o Residential
 150 GPM – (2.5 gallons per second) (1.75” hose lines with automatic nozzles)
o Commercial
 250 GPM - (5 gallons per second) (2” and 2.5” hose lines with fixed gallonage
or smooth bore nozzles)
 500 GPM - (8 gallons per second) (portable appliances)
 600+ GPM – (10+ gallons per second) (deck gun or ladder pipe)
These expectations meet or exceed national best practices and NFPA 1700 and 1710 guidance.
The current hose and nozzle packages that are carried on Phoenix Fire Engine Companies include:
o

1 ¾” hose line with automatic nozzles (x2 minimum)
 Hose lengths include:
FIRE CONTROL
Page 6 of 9

o

o

• 150’ crosslay
• 200’ crosslay
• 100’ to 150’ front bumper line
 Automatic nozzle (75/45 psi nozzle pressure for 70 to 200 GPM)
2” hoseline with smooth bore nozzles (x1)
 Hose length:
• 200’ crosslay or rear mount depending on apparatus manufacturer
 Smooth bore nozzles with 1 1/16” tip (240 GPM at 50 psi nozzle pressure)
2 ½” hose line with smooth bore nozzles (1 or 2 depending on apparatus
manufacturer)
 Hose length:
• 200’ rear mount (1 or 2 depending on apparatus manufacturer)
 Smooth bore nozzle with 1 3/16” tip (300 GPM at 50 psi nozzle pressure)
 Blitz Monitor with solid bore or peripheral tips (up to 500 GPM)

A necessary component of an effective fire attack is the firefighter's ability to operate specific hose
and nozzle packages at the required water flows. A component of effective and safe hose line
operation in a fire attack is nozzle reaction. Nozzle reaction is defined as the force exerted by the
fire nozzle on the Firefighter. The Phoenix Fire Department standard for nozzle reaction is 70 lbs.
for single Firefighter operations. Anything above should require additional Firefighters (s) or
operations from the fixed positions on the ground to operate effectively and safely. Any fire attack
operations should utilize as many Firefighters as required to deploy, flow, move, and ensure
operational safety depending on the line length, diameter, flow, and nozzle reaction.
The Phoenix Fire Department standard is as follows:
•
•
•
•

1 ¾” hoseline with 75 psi automatic nozzle (in high pressure/blue setting) @ 150 gpm
o 1 firefighter operation (average 65 lbs. nozzle reaction during testing)
1 ¾” hoseline with 45 psi automatic nozzle (in low pressure/red setting) @ 150 gpm
o 1 Firefighter operation (average 60 lbs. nozzle reaction during testing)
2” hoseline with 1 1/16” solid bore nozzle @ 240 gpm
o 2 Firefighter minimum operation (average 85 lbs. nozzle reaction during testing)
2 ½” hoseline with 1 3/16” solid bore nozzle @ 300 gpm
o 3 Firefighter minimum operation (average 110 lbs. nozzle reaction during testing)

A water supply is a critical component to an effective fire attack. Standard Phoenix Engine
Company apparatus typically carry 500 gallons of water (+ or – 50 gallons, depending on the
apparatus generation). There are a very small amount of exceptions to this in the Phoenix Fire
Department, and an intimate knowledge of each independent apparatus is always required. The
establishment of an uninterrupted water supply for declared working fires can be a critical
component to appropriately support an effective and safe fire attack.

FIRE CONTROL
Page 7 of 9

Specific circumstances exist that it is reasonable for a first due Engine Company (with at least 450
gallons of onboard water) to not establish a hydrant supply line. These include fires with an
unknown location or route to the location in a neighborhood or apartment/business complex, fire
in a high-rise building, fires with a known rescue situation requiring immediate action, and/or
anytime an Incident Commander has calculated the need for a rapid-fire attack before an initial
supply line can be established. It is always the Incident Commander’s and/or Sector Officer’s
responsibility (depending on incident complexity) to ensure adequate, uninterrupted water
supplies are in place in all critical tactical positions to support effective fire attack operations.
Strategic Level Considerations
It is the incident commander’s responsibility to ensure that an effective fire attack from the most
appropriate positions is part of the incident action plan. The positions and volume will be
dependent on the incident size, complexity, incident strategy, and available resources.
Command must define Offensive/Defensive Strategy based upon the position in the risk
management plan. In addition, Command will consider the following when addressing fire
control:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

Rescue profile of occupants
Fire/smoke volume
Fire extent
Structural conditions
Structural ingress and egress
Smoke conditions and ventilation profile
Available resources

A critical Command decision (both initial and ongoing) relates to the Offensive/Defensive Strategy
of the incident:
• Offensive Strategy—an exterior and/or interior fire attack, from inside the hazard zone, with
appropriate support work to best support creating and maintaining tenable spaces in
conjunction with search operations depending on the rescue profile and occupancy type.
• Defensive Strategy—A fire attack on the fire structure/occupancy from the most
advantageous positions and outside of the hazard zone. This fire attack should also work
to reduce fire extension into exposures, when possible, from the most advantageous
positions (interior or exterior), depending on structure, conditions, and position in the risk
management plan.
The Incident Commander will support any fire attack with whatever resources and action is
required to reduce fire extension and to bring the fire under control. Command must initially
declare the incident strategy and continue to confirm the strategy and the appropriate benchmarks
and elapsed time notifications.

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines for regional consistency regarding fire
incidents in large-space buildings with fire sprinklers (cold smoke fires). Large-space buildings are
structures with big, non-compartmentalized space(s). For example, warehouses, distribution
centers, shopping centers, data centers, churches, bowling alleys, gymnasiums, public assembly
occupancies, etc. Early incident operations necessitate controlling the advancement of interior
companies due to the increased potential of firefighters becoming disoriented. This requires a
strong command presence and focus on incident organization, communication, accountability,
hose line management, air management, work cycles, etc.
RISK MANAGEMENT
Fire sprinkler systems have over a 100-year history of protecting life and property from the
destructive forces of fire. History establishes that civilian fire fatalities in sprinklered buildings of
any type are extremely rare. In the absence of a report of people trapped, we can anticipate our
actions being focused on property protection and our application of risk management must align
as such.
Fire incidents in large-space buildings with fire sprinkler systems expose firefighters to many
challenges and hazards. These include but are not limited to:
•

Cold smoke refers to smoke that has lost its velocity and flows calmly. In other words,
smoke that lacks the speed, turbulence, or energy. Cold smoke is extremely dangerous.
The presence of cold smoke identified during size up is significant. Cold smoke can be
present with or without fire sprinkler control.

•

Regarding large-space buildings, a small amount of smoke from one or more locations can
mean a significant fire.
Factors of storage configuration such as height and type (e.g., rack storage, floor storage).
As materials get wet, they get heavier, and packaging can begin to break down causing
rack storage collapse.
Construction features including type, building size, fire rated enclosures, and large opened
areas.
Signs of an incident of any significance will typically require a first alarm or greater
response.
Large open interior spaces typically require truss construction. These large spans and
construction methods can lead to early structural collapse if fire is not contained by the fire
sprinkler system. Partial roof collapse should be assumed to have compromised the fire
sprinkler system.
Large-space buildings may have atypical roof characteristics that can be challenging for
roof operations to include vertical ventilation.
The types and quantities of materials stored may include hazardous materials.
Presence, type, and suitability of fire protection and detection systems.
Methods to facilitate ventilation such as roof vents, sky lights, doors, rollup doors, smoke
control and exhaust systems.
Available water supply and adequacy.
Fixed and mobile equipment/machines for material handling.
Warehouses with rolled paper storage are a significant hazard. In 1978, the fire sprinkler
system had contained a fire in a warehouse storing large bales of rolled paper. Three
Canadian firefighters were killed instantly during overhaul when 600-pound paper rolls
became unstable and toppled over burying them.
If the fire sprinkler system fails to control the fire for any reason, the fire will grow quickly.
We should anticipate fire control necessitating defensive operations and exterior fire
suppression via master streams outside of the collapse zone.

PRE-INCIDENT PLANNING
Pre-incident planning is critical as information gathered during planning visits before the incident
is used by Company and Command Officers during an actual incident. Pre-incident planning
allows personnel the opportunity to view conditions and factors within the structure or the site.
This allows for an evaluation of how these conditions and factors are likely to develop in the event
of an emergency incident. The following should be considered during pre-incident planning for
large-space buildings:
•

Exterior wall construction: Concrete, metal panel, masonry, wood frame, etc. This
information is important as it relates to fire extension potential, exposure protection,
collapse, and others.

LARGE-SPACE BUILDING COLD SMOKE FIRES
Page 2 of 4

•

•
•

•

•
•

•
•

Occupancy type: Office, retail, manufacturing, warehouse, etc. Each occupancy has unique
factors. Warehouses have rack storage, retail may have large storage areas (to include rack
storage areas not immediately evident), manufacturing may have specialized equipment
and hazardous materials.
Many new data centers and other large-space buildings may have battery energy storage
systems and/or photovoltaic systems (see M.P. 205.20, 205.20A, 205.02B)
Roof construction: The type and construction of the roof will impact ventilation. Wood joist,
steel joist, steel beam, etc. Decking material, wood plank, concrete, metal panel, etc. Roof
covering may have built up tar and gravel or insulated membrane systems. Pre-incident
planning should address how ventilation can be accomplished, to include the presence and
location of skylights, and any manual or automatic vents.
Ceilings and attics: False ceilings and common attics can lead to fire spread throughout the
structure. False ceilings and common attics can result in fires burning undetected in areas
not visible and absent fire sprinklers.
Interior configuration and storage: Presence and height of rack storage, large-opened
spaces, office areas and other separated spaces, fire walls, fire doors, smoke barriers, etc.
Fire protection systems: Automatic sprinkler systems, fire pumps, special protection
systems (e.g., dry chemical, foam, carbon-dioxide, etc.), standpipes, fire alarm systems,
smoke control systems, and water supply.
Site factors: Apparatus access and tactical positioning, security, exposures, utilities, etc.
Environmental: Runoff from fire sprinklers or other suppression efforts contaminated with
hazardous materials must be considered. This should include the location of drainage and
collection points as well as other potential exposures.

Premises alerts for rolled paper, hazardous materials, rack storage, and other hazards should be
entered into the CAD system when identified during pre-incident planning.
INCIDENT GUIDELINES
Early assessment of the seven sides of the structure is a high priority on these incidents. Size up
should include the identification of smoke, flames, or water runoff. Look for signs for fire
protection systems and the buildings Fire Department Connection (FDC). Look for a red bell on the
outside of the building. If the bell is ringing, water is very likely to be flowing out of the fire
sprinkler system. Some systems incorporate horn/strobe notification devices, listen for horns and
look for flashing strobes. Also, identify signs of hazardous materials to include particulate
scrubbers, containment areas, tanks, NFPA 704 Diamond(s), other signage, etc.
Determining the best access point(s) to the fire necessitates good size up of the building. Ideally,
firefighters have an awareness of the building established through pre-incident planning. When
operating in interior positions, firefighters must stay on the hose line, no complacency. Conditions
can change quickly. Fire companies should recognize the importance of utilization of thermal
imaging cameras (TIC), especially on these types of incidents due to the size of the building and
LARGE-SPACE BUILDING COLD SMOKE FIRES
Page 3 of 4

presence of cold smoke. The TIC camera is an excellent tool to support accountability and locating
the fire.
All personnel within the incident organization must effectively manage their responsibilities with
regard to work cycles, accountability, air management, communication (radio management), hose
line management, etc. Companies must not extend hose lines more than 150 feet into the building.
If you cannot find the fire, pull the firefighters out of the building and implement another plan. The
Incident Commander must be decisive with making the decision to switch to another plan,
understanding the dangers of interior companies operating in a hazardous position with a limited
air supply. Once firefighters are out of the building, regroup and implement plan B (this is the
Incident Commanders responsibility). Consideration should be given to pumping the FDC and
ventilating the building. Cold smoke fires should be approached in a similar manner to a
hazardous materials incident, recognizing the hazards and where the incident resides from a risk
management perspective. Ventilation options can include the utilization of fans, vertical
ventilation, opening sky lights, using specialty building systems, and/or hydraulic ventilation with
portable monitors. Ventilation will often utilize a variety of different options coordinated to ensure
effectiveness and realizing that ventilation of cold smoke is a slow process.
Pumping the FDC is a good thing. Additional GPM and pressure can have a major positive impact
on the effectiveness of fire sprinklers. Remember, every decision made should be coordinated.
Prior to pumping the FDC, consider if firefighters are interior and if a sudden increase in volume
and pressure may contribute to a rack storage collapse.
Note: Some large-space building fire protection systems are supported by a fire pump. Connecting
to the FDC in this instance is a precaution in the event of a fire pump failure.
Conversely, we should not shut down the fire sprinkler system prior to verification of fire control.
The outcome of testing after the Southwest Supermarket fire established the maximum distance
a fire company will enter any building is 150 feet, without additional support mechanisms put in
place by command. For cold smoke fires, if the fire cannot be located or accessed due to 150-foot
limitations, command must pull firefighters from interior positions, pump the FDC, and ventilate
the building. Command and operating personnel recognize that these tactics will take time. Once
smoke has cleared out and we have assurances that the incident has stabilized, fire companies
may go deeper than 150 feet into the building, if it is safe to do so. A Shift Commander should be
present to review and approve any plan that takes fire companies more than 150 feet in the
building. In this instance, a Battalion Chief with a Battalion Safety Officer should be in place to
manage the Sector. Remember, the incident commander controls the incident, not the other way
around. On cold smoke fires, we shall operate in the correct risk management position. If
firefighters cannot reach the fire, pull them out of the building. At this point, time is on your side.

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish safe and effective expectations for
fire operations (extinguishment, search, and loss control) in occupancies with
basements and/or below grade spaces. Basements and below grade
compartments pose significant threats to firefighters and can have challenging
circumstances that severally limit the ability to extinguish and search those spaces
when experiencing high heat and convective currents. Working on the floor above
a basement fire poses significant threats due to the potential for lightweight
construction and for working in the exhaust portion of the flowpath.
Basement Types
Basement design, location, and access are not standard. Access and ventilation
opportunities are limited, and fuel loads can be extraordinary and unpredictable.
Multiple types of basements exist in the Phoenix region. The 3 standard types
include:
•

•
•

No-access basement
o No external basement access with internal access only
o Root cellars are most common type of no-access basements in older
Phoenix regional occupancies
Limited-access basement
o External window access only, including walk up or lookout basements
Full-access basement
o External door or large escape window access, walkout or daylight
basement

Basements also are found in 2 distinct construction states. They include:
•

•

Finished
o Provides structural protection to structural floor components with a
potential for livable space (drywall, and interior compartment build
out)
Unfinished
o Provides no protection to structural floor components or livable
spaces

Size up
Early identification of basements and their access opportunities is critical. This
must be considered in the initial onscene size up and a component of the 360° size
up. The presence or lack of a basement must be communicated in the follow up
report. The early communication is necessary to minimize/eliminate the
opportunity for fire crews to end up working above a basement without their
knowledge. The immediate dangers include falling through the floor and working
in the exhaust portion of a flowpath.
The location of the fire in buildings/occupancies with basements is a critical
component of size up. The location and level of the fire in the building must be
recognized and communicated in the follow up, if known. There are multiple
examples of smoke or fire conditions from the exterior that are indicative of a
basement fire. They include:
•
•
•

Full exhaust ventilation at the first-floor entryway (smoking filling the entire
door) without the presence of a neutral plane
Smoke showing from roof vent pipes or a chimney
Below grade window or door opening that is a ventilation intake without
the presence of a neutral plane

Initial and ongoing size up from the most advantageous position(s) should utilize a
thermal imaging camera (TIC). Specific, on-going size up from interior positions
can be critical in locating the fire however is a poor assessment tool in assessing
structural integrity.
When a fire is located at the basement level, fire attack must begin on that level.
That includes basement windows, doors, or stairwells.

Determining the ventilation profile is an important part of the initial and ongoing
size up. Determining the air inlets and the smoke/fire exhaust points for the entire
structure improves the effectiveness of the fire attack and minimizes the safety
concerns of firefighters knowingly or unknowingly working within the exhaust side
of a flow path. Multiple serious injuries and deaths to Firefighters have been
experienced when Firefighters have entered the first/ground floor entrances with a
fire in the basement. Changes in the air inlets (ventilation) on the basement level
have created unsurvivable conditions for Firefighters on the first floor with the
exhaust point behind them.
Life safety should be a serious consideration in assessing the fire location, interior
access, and searchable space. An effective fire attack on the basement level is
about extinguishment as well as creating and maintaining searchable space.
Consideration must be given to the structural integrity of the floor joists system
while searching and working on fire control below them.
Risk Management
When a basement is present and conditions are such that there is a likely
basement fire, our actions must reflect good risk management decisions.
Assigning crews to the first floor, above the fire, has significant safety concerns
and should not be done until fire control has been achieved and the smoke has
been ventilated to determine the integrity of the floor sheeting and joists. Thermal
imagers and sounding the floor are not reliable means of determining the
structural integrity of the floor system, especially in buildings using lightweight
construction materials. Rugs and furniture can hide the areas of floor collapse or
areas burned away with no structural supports beneath.

Strategy
The incident strategy, when a basement is present, is dependent on the conditions
and resource capability to extinguish the fire prior to structural failure. An
offensive strategy is appropriate when the fire conditions will allow for fire attack
crews to extinguish the fire in the basement from the most advantageous
position(s) (interior and/or exterior). This extinguishment should be on the same
level as the basement and crews should determine the integrity of the floor joists
separating the basement and the upper floor(s).
A defensive strategy should be considered when crews cannot effectively apply
water into the basement from the most advantageous positions on the same level
of the basement. A defensive strategy should also be considered when there is
limited or zero capability to assess the floor joist integrity separating the
basement and the upper floor(s) or it is known that they are compromised.
It could be considered to change from a defensive strategy to an offensive strategy
once fire control has been achieved and the floor joists are examined, post
ventilation of the basement, to determine the ability to operate on top of the floor
joists.
Action
The most effective incident actions for fires in structures with a basement is to
extinguish the fire from the most advantageous position on the same level as the
fire and to minimize any ventilation prior to extinguishment. If the fire is found to
be in the basement, extinguishment from the most advantageous position(s)
(interior and/or exterior) should be executed prior to Firefighters making entry into
the level above the fire (first or ground floor). The fire attack must be with a
minimum of 150 gpm.
Search operations should be consistent with standard operations based on the
conditions and available resources to extinguish the fire. Search operations above
the fire require the extinguishment of the fire in the basement and the evaluation
of the integrity of the floor joists.
Ventilation should be coordinated prior to and during the fire attack. The creation
or enlarging of a ventilation opening on the basement level can increase the
velocity and pressure of air moving to the floor above, when an exhaust point is
open on the first/ground floor. Any Firefighter working in the exhaust portion of
that flowpath may experience unsurvivable heat conditions when the ventilation

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

BASEMENT AND BELOW GRADE FIRES
M.P. 202.04B

01/25-N

Page 5 of 5

exhaust is not controlled and there is no water on the fire. Ventilation after fire
extinguishment should be in the most effective method for the structure and the
openings. Increasing the number of air exhaust points and/or their size will
increase the velocity and pressure of the ventilation through the structure.
For fires in full-access and limited-access basements, the fire attack position
should be consistent with standard interior or exterior fire control as necessary.
The better the ability to apply water to the interior structural surfaces (walls,
ceiling, floor joist members) the more effective the cooling and extinguishment
will be. Attempting to extinguish the fire by cooling the air and not the surfaces
will be counterproductive and will not be effective.
For fires in no-access Basements, the ability to control the fire from exterior
positions in the most effective manners is minimal or nonexistent. The only
access point to the basement is typically from interior stairs. These interior stairs
will likely become the chimney for exhausting, superheated air/smoke traveling
from the basement to any ventilation openings/exhaust point on the first/ground
floor. The ability to flow water into the basement, onto the interior structural
surfaces from above or from the stairwell is extremely limited. Often water from
above ends up on the floor of the basement and not on the surfaces or materials
that are burning, and the extinguishment is very slow or limited. Using fog
streams or other appliances (Bresnan Distributor, penetrating nozzles, etc.) can be
considered but should not require firefighters to work from above the fire
(dangerous position) and may have minimal or limited success.
Overhaul and Loss control will be dependent on the structural conditions of the
floor joists and the ability operate inside or above the fire compartment.

Review Date: 12/2026
PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish general safety guidelines for operating personnel.
TACTICAL POSITIONING
Positioning of operating companies can severely affect the safety/survival of such companies.
Personnel must use caution when placed in the following positions:
• In the direct flow path of the fire
• Working into wind-driven conditions
• Above the fire (floors/roof)
• Where fire can move in behind or above them
• Where position and retreat cannot be controlled
• When involved with opposing fire streams
• Combining interior and exterior attack
• With limited access--one way in/out
• Operating under involved roof structures
• In areas containing hazardous materials
• Below ground fires (basements, etc.)
• In areas where a flashover or backdraft potential exists
• Above/below ground rescue
The safety of firefighting personnel represents the major reason for an effective and well-timed
offensive/defensive decision and the associate write-off by Command. THE TWO STRATEGIES
ARE BASED ON A STANDARD RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT IS TO BE EMPLOYED AT ALL
STRUCTURE FIRES.

STANDARD RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
WE MAY RISK OUR LIVES A LOT, IN A CALCULATED MANNER, TO PROTECT SAVABLE LIVES
WE MAY RISK OUR LIVES A LITTLE, IN A CALCULATED MANNER, TO PROTECT SAVABLE
PROPERTY
WE WILL NOT RISK OUR LIVES AT ALL FOR LIVES OR PROPERTY THAT IS ALREADY LOST
When operating in a defensive strategy, operating positions should be as far from the involved
area as possible while still remaining effective. Position and operate from behind barriers if
available (fences, walls, etc.). The intent is for personnel to utilize safe positioning where
possible/available, in an effort to safeguard against sudden hazardous developments such as
explosion, structural collapse, down-powerlines, smoke, collision of heavy equipment, etc.
When operating in an offensive strategy, a controlled aggressive attack is required for firefighter
safety. An effective, coordinated interior attack operation directed toward knocking down the fire
eliminates most eventual safety problems. The operational focus should be to get water on the
fire from the most effective position available. Water on the fire improves interior conditions for
savable victims and firefighters.
Due to the inherent hazards of the fire or incident scene, efforts must be made by Command to
limit the number of personnel on the fireground to those assigned to a necessary function. All
personnel shall be:
• Responding
• Positioned in Staging
• Assigned to a task or operating within a sector
• Released to in-service status
The intent of this procedure is to minimize fireground confusion/congestion and to limit the
number of personnel exposed to fireground hazards to only those necessary to successfully
control the operation. Individuals or crews shall be restricted from wandering about the
fireground or congregating in non-functional groups. If personnel have not been assigned to a
sector or do not have a necessary staff function to perform, they shall remain outside the
fireground perimeter.
When it is necessary to engage personnel in exceptionally hazardous circumstances (i.e., to
perform a rescue), Command will limit the number of personnel exposed to an absolute minimum
and assure that all feasible safety measures are taken.

FIREGROUND SAFETY
Page 2 of 10

In extremely hazardous situations (e.g., flammable liquids, LP gas, special operations, etc.)
Command will engage only an absolute minimum number of personnel within the hazard zone.
Unmanned fire streams (typically master streams) will be utilized wherever possible.
In situations where crews must operate from opposing or conflicting positions, such as front vs.
rear attack streams, roof crews vs. interior crews, etc., utilize radio or face-to-face communications
to coordinate your actions with those of the opposing crew in an effort to prevent needless
injuries. It is critical that opposing or conflicting operations are avoided whenever possible.
Notification and coordination between Company Officers, Sector Officers, and Command is
necessary to manage conflicting operations.
Ground crews must be notified and evacuated from interior positions before ladder pipes go into
operation. Command or Sector Officers should consider obtaining a PAR prior to ladder pipes
going into service.
Do not operate exterior master streams into an area where interior crews are operating. Caution
needs to be used if exterior hand line application is flowing water into a compartment where
interior crews are operating. This procedure is intended to prevent injuries to firefighters and
structural collapse.
When laddering a roof, the ladder selected shall be one which will extend 2' - 3' above the roof
line. This shall be done in an effort to provide personnel operating on the roof with a visible means
of egress.
If possible, when laddering buildings under fire conditions, place ladders near building corners or
fire walls as these areas are generally more stable in the event of structural failure.
The ROCC recommends that personnel should be tethered to a ladder/platform anchorage point
on the platform any time the device is in motion and whenever you are off the ground unless you
are actively climbing or descending the ladder or entering or exiting the platform.
When operating either above or below ground level, establish at least two separate escape
routes/means where possible, (such as stairways, ladders, exits, etc.), preferably at opposite ends
or diagonal corners of the building or separated by considerable distance.
Hot Zone
The Hot Zone will be defined as any area that requires an SCBA, charged hoseline, special
protective clothing, or in which firefighting personnel are at risk of becoming lost, trapped, or
injured by the environment or structure. The following situations would be included inside the Hot
Zone:
• Entering a structure reported to be on fire
FIREGROUND SAFETY

•
•

Operating in close proximity to an involved structure during exterior operations
Confined Space
Trench Rescues
Operating close to crane operations or close to swift water operations
Building collapse
Operating close to helicopter operations
Extrication

ALL FIREFIGHTERS WORKING IN THE HOT ZONE SHALL BE IN CREWS OF A MINIMUM OF TWO
PERSONNEL, WEARING APPROPRIATE PPE, WITH A RADIO ON THE CORRECT TACTICAL
CHANNEL AND MUST HAVE AN ASSIGNED TASK OR FUNCTION. THE ACCOUNTABILITY
SYSTEM WILL BE IN PLACE.
Warm Zone
The Warm Zone will be defined as the area just outside of the Hot Zone where the firefighters start
their operations on the fireground. This zone is where the firefighter is not at risk of becoming
lost, trapped, or injured by the environment or structure. The following functions could be done
inside the Warm Zone:
• Forward fire apparatus working the incident (e.g., engines, ladders, etc.)
• Laying lines
• Hazmat and TRT developing strategies & tactics
• Utility trucks
• Special equipment needs
• Accountability Officer
• Fire Investigations
If at any time firefighters in the Warm Zone become threatened, this area would become a Hot
Zone.
Cold Zone
The Cold Zone will be defined as outside of the Warm Zone where no one is at risk because of the
incident. The following functions could be done inside the Cold Zone:
• Command
• Level I & Level II staging
• Support and staff personnel
• Canteen
• Rehab
• Media

FIREGROUND SAFETY
Page 4 of 10

All operating personnel must remain vigilant on emergency incidents. Just because your
operating in a Cold Zone does not mean there is no risk. Apparatus movements, traffic, and
unforeseen violence are just a few examples of potential hazards at all incidents.
No-Entry Zone
The No-Entry Zone is defined as the area at an incident that no person shall be permitted to enter
due to an imminent hazard, dangerous condition, or the need to protect evidence. Operating
personnel need to be informed of the No-Entry Zone; during nighttime operations consideration
should be given to illumination of the No-Entry Zone.
When possible, control zones should be identified with colored hazard tape or other appropriate
means parallel to NFPA 1521 guidance.
• Hot Zone: Red
• Warm Zone: Yellow
• Cold Zone: Green
• No-Entry Zone: Red and white diagonal-striped or chevron
SECTORS
The safety of firefighting personnel represents a major reason for fireground sectorization. Sector
Officers must maintain the capability to communicate with forces under their command so that
they can control both the position and function of their companies.
Sector Officers and Company Officers shall be able to account for the whereabouts and welfare of
all crews/crew members under their assignment.
Company Officers shall insure that all crew members are operating within their assigned sector
only. Crews will not leave their respective sectors unless authorized by the Sector Officer.
When crews are operating within a sector, Company Officers shall keep the Sector Officer
informed of changing conditions within the sector area, and particularly those changing
conditions which may affect the safety of personnel.
Hazards that will affect only a specific sector area should be dealt with within that sector and need
not necessarily affect the entire operation.
SAFETY SECTOR
The recognition of situations which present inordinate hazards to fireground personnel and the
proper response to safeguard personnel from those hazards is of critical importance to all Fire
Department operations.

FIREGROUND SAFETY
Page 5 of 10

Command has the responsibility to recognize situations involving a high risk to personnel and to
initiate appropriate safety measures.
Command shall establish appropriate additional safety oversite at incidents involving an
inordinate danger to personnel. Command may consider establishing a Safety Sector on any
situation where it may be advantageous to the overall safety of operations.
When the need for specialized assistance is identified, Command should confirm the response of
the appropriate personnel (Safety Officer/Structural Engineer).
Command may designate any available personnel to establish a Safety Sector when the need is
indicated. This should be a high priority assignment.
The establishment of a Safety Sector in no way diminishes the responsibility of all officers for the
safety of their assigned personnel. Each and every member shall utilize common (safety) sense
and work within the intent of established safety procedures at all times.
STRUCTURAL COLLAPSE
Structural collapse has been a major cause of serious injury and death to firefighters. The
possibility of structural collapse should be a major consideration in the development of any
incident action plan. All fireground personnel should consider the possibility of structural collapse
in the decision-making process.
Structural collapse is always a possibility when a building is subject to intense fire. In fact, if fire
is allowed to affect a structure long enough, structural failure is inevitable.
Regardless of the age and exterior appearance of the building, the possibility exists that a principal
structural supporting member is being seriously affected by heat and may collapse, inflicting
serious injury to firefighters.
Example: A 100' length of unprotected steel will expand 9" when heated to 1100o F.
In the typical fire involved building, the roof is the most likely candidate for failure, however failure
of the roof may very likely trigger a collapse of one or more wall sections. This is especially true
if the roof is a peak or dome type which may exert outward pressure against both the bearing and
non- bearing walls upon collapse. In multi-story buildings or buildings with basements, the floor
section above the fire may collapse if supporting members are directly exposed to heat and
flames.
A knowledge of various types of building construction can be invaluable to all firefighters from a
safety standpoint as certain types of construction can be expected to fail sooner than others. For
FIREGROUND SAFETY
Page 6 of 10

example, light weight truss and bar joist roof construction can be expected to fail after minimal
fire exposure.
Structures have been known to collapse without warning but usually there are indications which
may tip off an alert firefighter. Action shall be taken to avert any imminent hazard.
Signs of building collapse may include:
• Cracks in exterior walls
• Bulges in exterior walls
• Sounds of structural movement--creaking, groaning, snapping, etc.
• Smoke or water leaking through walls
• Water accumulation on a roof
• Windows, doors, floors and stairs out of level
• Flexible movement of any floor or roof where firefighters walk
• Interior or exterior bearing walls or columns--leaning, twisting or flexing
• Sagging or otherwise distorted rooflines
• Time of fire involvement
The following construction features or conditions have been known to fail prematurely or to
contribute to early structural failure when affected by fire.
Contributing Factors:
• Parapet walls
• Large open (unsupported) areas--supermarkets, warehouses, etc.
• Large signs or marquees--which may pull away from weakened walls
• Cantilevered canopies--which usually depend on the roof for support and may collapse as
the roof fails
• Ornamental or secondary front or sidewalls--which may pull away and collapse
• Buildings with light weight truss, bar joist, or bow string truss, roofs
• Buildings supported by unprotected metal--beams, columns, et
• Buildings that are under construction, renovation or are otherwise not completed
Buildings containing one or more of the above features must be constantly evaluated for collapse
potential. These evaluations should be a major consideration in determining the strategy, i.e.
offensive/defensive.
It is a principal Command responsibility to continually evaluate and determine if the fire building
is tenable for interior operations. This on-going evaluation of structural/fire conditions requires
the input of Company Officers advising their Sector Officers and of Sector Officers advising
Command of the conditions in their area of operation.

FIREGROUND SAFETY
Page 7 of 10

Most structures are not designed to withstand the effects of fire and can be expected to fail if
exposed to heavy fire involvement. If after 10-15 minutes of interior operations heavy fire
conditions still exist, Command should initiate a careful evaluation of structural conditions, and
should be fully prepared to withdraw interior crews and change to a defensive strategy.
If structural failure of a building or section of a building appears likely, a No-Entry Zone must be
established a safe distance from the area which may collapse. All personnel must remain outside
this perimeter.
EVACUATION OF FIREFIGHTING PERSONNEL
Interior firefighting operations should be abandoned when the extent of the fire prohibits control,
or the structure becomes unsafe to operate within. When such conditions make the building
untenable, evacuate, account for personnel, regroup, recommunicate, and redeploy.
Our primary concern, when a hazard which may affect the safety of fire personnel becomes
apparent, is the welfare of those personnel. In an effort to protect personnel who may suffer the
adverse effects of hazards such as structural collapse, explosion, backdraft, etc., a structured
method of area evacuation must be utilized, one which will provide for the rapid/effective
notification of those personnel involved, and one which will be able to accurately account for those
personnel.
Crews retreating from interior operations often require hoseline protection. The protection
afforded to firefighting personnel in such situations represents a major function of back-up lines.
The method of evacuation selected will vary depending on the following circumstances:
• Imminence of the hazard
• Type and extent of hazard
• Perception of the area affected by the hazard
The "Emergency Traffic” announcement is designed to provide immediate notification for all
fireground personnel. The use of "Emergency Traffic" should be initiated only when the hazard
appears to be imminent or has just occurred. Any member has the authority to utilize the
"Emergency Traffic" announcement when it is felt that a notable danger to personnel is apparent;
however, considerable discretion should be applied to its use - emergency traffic announcements
become ineffective if overused.
When an imminent hazard has been realized, the emergency traffic process should be initiated.
Usually, a Company or Sector Officer will be the initiator. The initiator should describe the
apparent hazard and order a suitable response, usually to evacuate a particular area or section,
according to the scope of the hazard.

FIREGROUND SAFETY
Page 8 of 10

If possible, the Sector Officers of those areas to be evacuated should request an acknowledgment
of the emergency traffic dispatch from those crews to be evacuated.
Upon receipt of the emergency traffic evacuation order, Company Officers shall assemble their
crews and promptly exit to a safe location, where the Company Officer will report a PAR for all
crew members. Shortly after the evacuation order, Sector Officers shall begin the process of
accounting for all evacuated crews. When all affected crews and crew members are accounted
for, the Sector Officer will report a PAR for that Sector. At this time a more specific determination
as to the reality/extent of the hazard can be made and efforts initiated to redeploy/redirect efforts.
Building evacuation generally involves a shift from an offensive to a defensive strategy. In such
cases, Command must develop a corresponding operational plan and must communicate that
plan to all operating companies. It is extremely important that everyone is notified and recognizes
that a shift in strategy has been made. This transition can be time consuming based on company’s
interior positions.
Hazards of a less than imminent nature should usually be handled by a consultation of Command,
Sector Officers, Safety Officers, Company Officers or other personnel. Personnel should make a
determination of the nature and possible effect of the suspected hazard and advise Command so
that a more well-informed decision can be made.
SEARCH AND RESCUE
Search and rescue should be performed according to an efficient, well planned procedure which
includes the safety of search crew personnel. The object of the search effort is to locate possible
victims, not create additional ones by neglecting the safety of the search crew.
Fire victims are typically killed through thermal and/or toxic exposure. The closer a victim is to
the fire the greater the chance of thermal exposure. Toxic exposure is not directly connected to
the proximity to the fire but in any area affected by smoke and the products of combustion. In
either form of exposure, the most survivable space in any structure or compartment is at the floor
level.
Prior to entering the search area, all search team members should be familiar with a specific
search plan including the overall objective, a designation of the search area, individual
assignments, etc. This may require a brief conference among crew members before entering the
search area to develop and communicate the plan. Individual search activities should be
conducted by two or more members when possible.
For residential search and rescue operations, firefighters may search off the hoseline. Company
Officers must maintain an awareness of the position and function of all members within their crew

FIREGROUND SAFETY
Page 9 of 10

during search operations. For non-residential fire operations, firefighters should not be operating
off of the hoseline.
A brief look around the floor below the fire may provide good reference for the search team, as
floors in multi-story occupancies usually have a similar layout.
Whenever a search is conducted that exposes search crews to fire conditions (particularly above
the fire floor) the search team should be protected with a charged hose line.

Page 1 of 2

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to identify the strategic and tactical approach for the deployment of
thermal imaging cameras (also referred to as TIC’s).
SIZE-UP
The TIC may provide valuable information during size-up, which can assist the Incident Commander in
determining the strategy and formulating the incident action plan. Early identification of tactical
priorities/needs can prove beneficial in placing initial and subsequent attack lines. When a company
officer or incident commander arrives on the scene, one of the first challenges is to identify the location of
the fire. A TIC can save a great deal of time by helping to pinpoint a concentration of heat within a
particular area of the building, especially in large commercial or multistory structures. An incident
commander, armed with this knowledge, can better direct firefighters regarding their point of entry and
plan of attack so as to optimize their resources.
Even before firefighters enter a burning structure, the incident commander or company officer can
accomplish a great deal from the exterior with the aid of thermal imaging technology. Some factors that
can be assessed from the outside include finding the seat of the fire, observing changing or spreading
conditions, identifying critical building construction features and identifying conditions that could threaten
structural integrity. A sector officer will also benefit from this information in assessing the operational
objectives, progress and needs within the sector.
DEPLOYMENT
The early and rapid deployment of the Thermal Imaging Camera (TIC), while operating in an Offensive
Strategy, may enhance the visibility in a visibly diminished atmosphere, thus increasing fire fighter safety
and survival, as well as improving the survival potential of our customers.
The TIC can also be deployed while operating in a Defensive Strategy. It can provide the Incident
Commander or Company Officer with valuable information during size-up. Early identification of structural
compromise, fire location in the structure, e.g. attic, and identification of severely threatened exposures
would provide valuable information when determining the strategy. This information would also aid in
identifying key tactical positions/needs. By deploying a TIC to the exposures, information could be
obtained as to the extent of impingement to the exposed structure, early identification of avenues of fire
spread and possibly any hot spots, which could cause extension.
It shall be the responsibility of the Company Officer/Command to rapidly deploy the TIC in a visibly
diminished atmosphere or in an atmosphere that may suddenly become visibly diminished.

PRIMARY APPLICATION
The primary use of the TIC for the fire department is for conducting search/rescue and crew
accountability tasks. The use of a TIC can prove to be a useful tool during search and rescue tasks by
reducing the amount of time it may take using standard search techniques. This will lead to a more
effective and organized search, while quickly identifying the fire. By locating the fire quickly, we will better
be able to determine our tactical priorities and rescue priorities (do we remove the victims from the fire or
remove the fire from the victims).
The TIC will enhance the ability to maintain crew accountability by increasing the vision capabilities of the
operator/Company Officer. This will ultimately lead to enhanced fire fighter safety while working in a
hostile environment. This does not replace the accountability tasks required of the captain and
each individual operating on the fireground. We must stay together in complex situations and/or
structures in order to enhance our survival.
While the TIC may enhance the operation of the crews on the fireground, it is imperative to
realize, that with any tool, there are limitations. TIC deployment into the operation should not
propagate a sense of security. Crews and TIC operators must be aware that the TIC may
malfunction and sole reliance on the camera is not prudent fire fighting. Additionally, it should
not replace or violate the core of our experience, training, safety procedures, or standard fire
fighting practices/principles. As always, safety must be the top priority.

It is the policy of the Phoenix Fire Department that all personnel expected to respond and function in
areas of atmospheric contamination, shall be equipped with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)
and trained in its proper use and maintenance.
Members shall achieve a NON-LEAKING facepiece-to-skin seal WITH THE MASK. Facial hair shall not
be allowed at points where the SCBA facepiece is designed to seal with the face. INDIVIDUAL
MEMBERS SHALL BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THIS REQUIREMENT.
Each member of the Operations Division shall be accountable for one SCBA and shall check the
condition of that SCBA at the beginning of each shift, after each use, and at any other time it may be
necessary to render the equipment in a ready state of condition. Each member shall be accountable
for their personal facepiece and regulator. Each member is also required to undergo a physical
examination annually if they are expected to respond and function in areas of atmospheric
contamination.
Company Officers shall assign a specific SCBA to each crew member. Each crew member will be
responsible for the proper use and function of that SCBA.
If a SCBA is found to be functioning improperly, it shall be taken out of service, red tagged, reported,
and replaced immediately. Replacement SCBAs shall be obtained from Resource Management or
from the on-duty RM50 Captain after normal business hours.
The intent of the SCBA policy is to avoid any respiratory contact with products of combustion, superheated gases, toxic products or other hazardous contaminants.
The use of breathing apparatus means that all personnel shall have facepieces in place, breathing air
from the supply provided. Where appropriate, Airline-Supplied Breathing Apparatus may be used in
place of SCBA.
SCBA SHALL BE USED BY ALL PERSONNEL OPERATING:
• IN A CONTAMINATED ATMOSPHERE
• IN AN ATMOSPHERE WHICH MAY SUDDENLY BECOME CONTAMINATED
• IN AN ATMOSPHERE WHICH IS OXYGEN DEFICIENT
• IN AN ATMOSPHERE WHICH IS SUSPECTED OF BEING CONTAMINATED OR OXYGEN
DEFICIENT
This includes all personnel operating:
• In an active fire area
• Directly above an active fire area
• In a potential explosion or fire area, including gas leaks and fuel spills

In addition to the above, SCBA shall be worn by all personnel operating at fire incidents above ground,
below ground or in any other area which is not, but which may become contaminated by products of
combustion or other hazardous substances. In these circumstances only, the SCBA may be worn with
the facepiece removed. The wearing of SCBA in these situations provides that it will be immediately
available for use if conditions change or if personnel are to enter an area where the use of SCBA is
required.
Premature removal of SCBA must be avoided at all times. This is particularly significant during
overhaul when smoldering materials produce increased quantities of toxic substances including
carcinogens. Firefighters should be mindful that exposure to products of combustion, such as smoke,
does not require visible conditions.
If there is any doubt about respiratory safety, SCBA use shall be maintained until the atmosphere is
established to be safe by testing. Hazard or Safety Sector personnel are typically responsible for this
determination. This is required in complex situations, particularly when toxic materials may be involved.
An evaluation of all members of the Operations Division in the use of the SCBA should be conducted
annually. Each member shall be able to demonstrate a high level of proficiency and compatibility with
the SCBA under conditions which simulate those expected as a job requirement. Each member shall
also demonstrate an effective facepiece to skin seal of the SCBA facepiece.

Air Management

M.P. 202.05C

01/18

Page 1 of 6

Purpose
The following procedure outlines the “Rule of Air Management” to be employed by all
members while operating in the hazard zone of an incident. The practice of working in the
hazard zone until the low air alarm sounds and then leaving is an extremely dangerous
situation.
As firefighters, we are responsible for our own safety and the safety of our fellow firefighters.
The ability to manage our individual air supply and consumption is critical to the safety of every
member working in the hazard zone. A poor decision in air management will adversely affect
the individual firefighter as well as every firefighter involved in attempting to rescue that
firefighter.
History
Historically, most working fires that the Phoenix Regional Dispatch System have responded to
were single and multiple family residences. These structures are typically smaller in size with
easy egress to the exterior. Firefighting in these “typical” residential structures resulted in a
decreased focus on air supply management. When the practice of working until the low air
alarm activates and then exiting is applied to fires at commercial occupancies there can be life
threatening consequences.
The Phoenix Regional Dispatch System has experienced multiple incidents that have involved
air supply emergencies. These incidents have typically ended with a successful intervention and
have not changed the overall approach to air management. After Bret Tarver’s death at the
Southwest Supermarket fire in 2001, the Phoenix Fire Department conducted numerous
training exercises to examine the causes and possible solutions for life threatening emergency
situations during commercial and/or “big box” fires. The exercises concluded that when the low
air alarm is activated, the firefighter can travel less than 150 feet in good conditions until the air
supply is exhausted. In this time, if a firefighter experiences an emergency situation (loses
contact with his/her hose line, becomes entangled in wires, or becomes disoriented) the
possibility of surviving the encounter is significantly reduced.
Rule of Air Management
It is the individual firefighter’s responsibility to be aware of the amount of air in his/her SCBA
and his/her rate of consumption. All firefighters are responsible for managing their own air in
order to leave the hazard zone before the low air alarm activates.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Air Management

M.P. 202.05C

01/18

Page 2 of 6

Firefighters should leave the hazard zone with an emergency reserve, much like ocean divers. It
is critical for firefighters to understand that the last 33% of the air supply in an SCBA is the
emergency reserve. The initial 66% of air supply is the working and exiting air supply. This
includes gaining access, working toward the tactical objectives and leaving the hazard zone. If
an emergency situation is encountered, the emergency reserve (remaining 33%) air supply is to
be used to exit or survive until assistance can arrive. These percentages are appropriate
whether it is 2216psi, 3000psi or 4500psi SCBA bottle. The estimated working time for any SCBA
is dependent on a number of factors. These include the intensity of the work and the fitness of
the firefighter. Each individual firefighter should be cognizant of their air consumption in order
to safely follow this rule of air management.
Company officers must be cognizant their crew’s air consumption. The company officer must
plan for the crew’s exit time based physical exertion, distance required to exit to a safe
atmosphere and the remaining air pressures that are reported by the individual firefighters. It is
the individual firefighter’s responsibility to continually assess and report his/her air
consumption to his/her company officer.
Strategic Level Air Management:
The safety and welfare of all firefighters operating in the hazard zone falls directly to the
Incident Commander. The strategic level of air management is an ongoing process until the
hazard has been eliminated or all firefighters have successfully exited the hazard zone. Air
management is an important critical operating procedure related to the survival of every
firefighter. Although the incident commander is unable to directly manage that survivability
profile, procedures and resources should be utilized to directly support the firefighter’s safety
and welfare.
It is imperative that command continually evaluates the incident using the standard hazard
zone decision making model. Operating in an offensive strategy is the most dangerous position
for firefighters. Air management must be a major factor of that assessment. The ability of
firefighters to exit the hazard zone with a reserve of 33% air is a requirement. If crews are
unable to complete their assigned task with that air supply intact, it is necessary for the incident
commander to provide an adequate number of companies to replace those initial working
crews or change the strategy to defensive.
The strategic level of air management should be managed similarly to the accountability of all
members operating in the hazard zone. Both are managed through position and function within
a command system. Command provides for improved management of firefighter welfare with
early sectorization of the incident. Sector officers should manage the individual sector tactical

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Page 3 of 6

benchmarks and crew welfare within the sector. Company Officers should manage the welfare
of their crew. Each firefighter is ultimately responsible for his/her own welfare.
The policy of air management for the Regional Operations Consistency Committee (ROCC) is; it
is unacceptable to leave the hazard zone with low air alarms activated during normal
operations.
This policy requires firefighters to leave without using their emergency reserve. This policy will
require that command and sector officers pessimistically forecast the resources required to
complete the tactical objectives in each. Fire crews are less apt to leave an operating tactical
position if there are no crews in position to replace them in the incident operation. It is the
Company Officer’s responsibility to manage the welfare of his/her crew; command must
support these crews with adequate replacement resources. The intent is not to adversely
impact the active firefight, but to strengthen firefighting operations with crews that have safe
air levels. Companies can be assigned only as fast as they arrive. A pessimistic approach would
provide needed replacement crews sooner, thus enabling them to follow the air management
procedures. These resources should be layered in as either working, on‐deck or recycling.
Time is a significant factor in both fire involvement and the air management of crews operating
within the hazard zone. It is impossible for the strategic level to manage the individual
operating times of all sectors or crews operating within the hazard zone. Each sector officer is
required to manage the time crews operate inside the hazard zone within their sector. The
strategic level will manage the entire elapsed time for the incident and the effect time has on
the structure or hazard.
Tactical Level of Air Management
Captain Level Sector Management
In the initial stages of rapidly escalating fire incidents, company officers assume the role of the
initial sector officer and are responsible for the tactical level air management of the sector. The
first Captain to the area will typically remain working with his/her crew and will manage the
tactical objectives for the sector and task level operations for his/her company. As other
companies are assigned to that sector, the initial sector officer will be at a disadvantage in
attempting to manage the welfare (specifically the air consumption) of those crews. The initial
sector officer will need support from all captains in that sector to closely manage their crew’s
air. As the incident escalates, command must assign a tactical level Chief Officer to manage the
sector operations.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Air Management

M.P. 202.05C

Page 4 of 6

Battalion Chief Level Sector Management
The tactical level of fireground operations has more direct control of individual crew air
management (specifically the air consumption time) than the incident commander. However,
the sector officer is often required to manage the sector operations from just outside the
hazard zone. This requires close management of work cycles and accountability in order to
actively monitor crew air supplies. This is done by the team of the Battalion Chief and the Field
Incident Technician (F.I.T.) or Incident Safety Officer (I.S.O.). Typically, the F.I.T. / I.S.O. will
monitor the work/rest cycles of operating companies within the sector while the Battalion Chief
manages the completion of the tactical objectives. One of the many responsibilities of the F.I.T.
/ I.S.O. includes monitoring the time operating within the hazard zone and providing reminders
to crews of elapsed times on SCBA air.
It is necessary for sector officers to perform their own hazard assessment and apply the
standard decision‐making model within their portion of the overall incident. This assessment
verifies the overall risk management and strategy from the tactical viewpoint. It should also
ensure that the actions within the sector match the strategy and risk management profile of
the overall incident. The sector officer must define where the crews will operate in the building
and what tasks need to be completed. These actions have to be balanced with air management
and a well communicated exit plan.
Sector officers must provide pessimistic reports to command regarding resources needed to
provide uninterrupted work cycles within the sector. This is necessary until the tactical
benchmarks are met within that sector. It is important to have ample crews to provide
immediate relief to crews that have diminished their air supply. This requires maintaining
adequate “on‐deck” resources. Adequate “on‐deck” resources provide crews to cycle into the
hazard zone as well as crews that are ready to react to a “Mayday”. Early forecasting of
necessary resources will provide command with the information needed to establish resource
requirements for the overall incident.
There is no greater concern for sector officers than the welfare of crews working within the
sector. Crew air management is a critical factor in determining the risk management of an
operating sector. If critical fireground factors or the ability to manage air supplies change
negatively, then this should be communicated to command and a re‐evaluation of the strategy
should be conducted.
Task Level Air Management
Individual firefighter air management is the foundation of this air management policy. No
incident command system or structure can overcome a lack of individual firefighter air

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

management. The policy is to leave the hazard zone prior to the SCBA low air alarm sounding.
This leaves an emergency reserve of 33% air capacity if an emergency situation arises.
Firefighting operations, at all levels, should revolve around this standard.
Personal accountability for the SCBA is critical. Firefighters are expected to manage their
assigned SCBA for the entire work shift. This requires thoroughly checking the SCBA prior to
shift, after using it, and whenever the functionality is in question. Firefighters are expected to
know the air level of their SCBA prior to entering the hazard zone, during firefighting activities
and upon leaving the hazard zone. This standard has been known as a “round trip ticket”. The
ability to monitor this supply during firefighting activities is a learned skill/habit. It is necessary
that company officers reinforce the need to adhere to work cycles to their crews. Command
and sector officers should ensure confidence that the work will continue while the relieved
crews are refilling and returning to on‐deck in their sector.
Air management is critical to individual firefighters as well as to their crew and company officer.
The company officer is responsible for the management of air for the entire crew. It is the
responsibility of the individual firefighter to monitor his/her air supply and to communicate this
with the Captain. Captains are expected to be proactive and inquire about the air level status of
their crew. Captains should incorporate the use of triggers to assess their crew’s air supply.
These can be the announcement of the completion of tactical benchmarks, elapsed time
notifications or built in 50% notification alarms on some SCBA manufacturers. The use of
triggers is a learned skill and will require consistent training and practice. Captains can only
address situations that they are aware of. The communication of individual air levels is critical.
Low air emergencies or other mayday events pose an extreme danger to firefighters involved in
rescue efforts. Data obtained from training exercises after the Southwest Supermarket fire
indicates that it takes 12 rescuers to remove one firefighter in a “MAYDAY” situation. The data
also demonstrated that one out of every five rescuers will end up having a “MAYDAY” situation
and require assistance exiting the hazard zone. This creates a deadly cycle. Air management at
all levels of command as well as individual firefighter responsibility is critical in the prevention
of these situations. If members believe themselves or other members to be in this situation, the
call for a “Mayday” should be immediate.
One requirement for a firefighter to be “MAYDAY” ready is that they are able to effectively don,
doff and manipulate the PASS Device and the emergency bypass on their SCBA valve with
gloved hands. This is also a learned skill that is perishable if not trained on consistently. This is
the standard established in NFPA 1500.
Fire crews operating inside structures should always have an “exit plan”. This is not just the
responsibility of the Captain. The Captain should communicate to the crew his/her exit plan.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Air Management

M.P. 202.05C

The individual firefighters are responsible for maintaining awareness of the plan and how to
execute the plan. The plan defines how the crew is going to leave their area of operation
(hazard zone). The best plan includes leaving the hazard zone following the hose line out that
you came in on. This includes normal operations as well as emergency situations. The plan
should include the entrance taken into the building, the dedicated hose line, knowledge of
other means of egress within the sector and other crews operating in the sector. This plan also
includes the amount of air it takes to leave the hazard zone prior to the low air alarm sounding.
The larger the building, the more important and difficult the exit plan becomes.
The results of the testing after the Southwest Supermarket has stated that the maximum
distance a fire crew will enter any building is 150 feet without additional support mechanisms
put in place by command. This defines only the distance into the building. This does not
account for the air it takes to maneuver a hand line into this position. The effort required (air
consumption) to place lines in operational positions inside the building is critical to managing
air and time operating inside the hazard zone. Crews and company officers must account for
this effort within their entrance and exit plans from the hazard zone.
There is one air management policy for residential and commercial occupancies of all sizes for
the Regional Operations Consistency Committee (ROCC). Command, sector officers, fire crews
and individual fire department members are expected to manage their air supplies in the same
manner on all types of incidents.

PURPOSE
This procedure identifies the Roof Sector's responsibilities and objectives. It will also
demonstrate that fireground communication and coordination among all sectors are
paramount for fireground safety when roof operations are underway.
Responsibilities for Roof Sector
Companies assigned to roof sector hold a highly valuable tactical position on the
fireground. This position has multiple responsibilities. They include critical size-up from
an aerial apparatus or on the roof surface as well as the ability to provide coordinated
vertical ventilation, when appropriate. The key functions of a Roof Sector include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Determine roof type and construction materials.
Determine roof integrity.
Determine roof loads and structural features that impact the fire conditions,
extinguishment, and/or search operations.
Determine the presence of an attic space or horizontal void or concealed spaces.
Determine fire extension in common attics, common void spaces, and in difficult
areas to access via interior positions.
Effective, ongoing communication of conditions with the IC, Sector Officers, and/or
Engine Companies working on the interior.
Consideration of ventilation needs and methods.
Coordinate vertical ventilation with the IC, Sector Officers, and/or Engine
Companies working on the interior.
Consider a fire attack from the roof when the fire conditions are challenging or
impossible to reach from the interior or positions on the ground.

Command should consider assigning companies to roof sector during offensive fire
operations to evaluate fire/smoke conditions, roof structural conditions, and to assess the
ability to vertically ventilate. Ladder Companies operating on the roof are in an
advantageous position to provide a size up and information regarding the key elements
of fire extension, building layout/features, endangered exposures, and structural stability.
It may be necessary to establish a Roof Sector in a position remote from the fire-involved
roof to keep a watchful eye on roof conditions, where imminent collapse will occur. Such
a location may be an elevated platform or an adjacent building.
Apparatus placement for Ladder Companies is a critical component. Ladder apparatus
should be strategically placed to allow safe access to the roof, emergency exit from the
roof, and in tactical positions that would permit effective defensive operations, if needed.
In some cases, the ability to access the roof with an aerial device and be in a defensive
position are impossible to do simultaneously (e.g., in big box or multi-story structures).
This needs to be communicated and assessed to determine the most advantageous
action based on incident conditions and the building.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

M.P. 202.06

10/24

Page 2 of 5

Safe roof operations are paramount. Companies assigned to Roof Sector will be
supervised by the Company Officer who must be with the crew on the roof. Roof Sector
crews must enter the roof from an established safe area and should have a secondary
means of egress to exit the roof, or to a safe refuge on an unexposed and structurally
sound roof surface.
The first personnel reaching the roof must quickly evaluate conditions to ensure the roof
is structurally sound before attempting to work on it. The degree and extent of any signs
of weakness must be considered before committing personnel above the fire. Once on
the roof, the Company Officer/Sector Officer and Firefighters/Engineers must evaluate
their route and progress as they proceed out on the roof. A constant re-evaluation of roof
safety must be maintained throughout roof operations. Time and fire conditions will be
constantly working to weaken the roof.
Commercial vs. Residential
There is a distinct difference in construction design, size, and materials between
commercial and residential roof systems. Roof Sector must be aware of these differences,
which could potentially impact roof operations and interior sectors.
Bowstring Roofs
No firefighter shall operate on or under a bowstring roof if there is any evidence that the
fire has penetrated the attic space involving the trusses or the roof structure in any way.
When the fire involves a room or contents with no evidence of structural extension, a
quick, aggressive, offensive strategy may be appropriate.
Metal Roofs
Buildings with metal roofs have the potential to limit roof operations. Once the Ladder
Company Officer evaluates the roof, the decision to operate on it or not will be
communicated to Command. Ladder Companies will not operate on pitched metal roofs.
Single Family and Duplex - Tile Roofs
No firefighters will operate on the roof to ventilate a single-family or duplex structure fire
covered with concrete or clay roof tiles. It will be necessary to develop a plan for
horizontal or positive pressure ventilation with the fire attack companies and/or
command.
Commercial / Multi-Story, Multi-Family Occupancy Tile Roofs
Should it be necessary for Fire Companies to gain access to the roof for size-up, search
for fire extension, and/or vertical ventilation this is allowable with a clear measurement of
the conditions and appropriate risk management evaluation. Extreme caution must be
used when operating on these types of structures.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Buildings with Photovoltaic Roof Tile
No Firefighter shall operate on the roof of a structure with photovoltaic roof tiles. This
roof material and structure offers electrical hazards and surface hazards that are not
conducive to firefighting activities. As with residential tile roofs, it will be necessary to
develop a plan for horizontal or positive pressure ventilation with the fire attack
companies and/or Command.
Vertical Ventilation
The purpose of ventilation (vertical or other) is to remove super-heated, toxic smoke from
the fire area to improve tenability and the possible survivability of fire victims in
coordination with an effective fire attack. Vertical ventilation can offer the most efficient
form of ventilation of interior heat and gases when it is able to be done in the most
advantageous position. Vertical ventilation directly over the fire compartment is the most
efficient option. It minimizes the drawing of super-heated gases out of the fire
compartment and into uninvolved areas of the structure, further endangering possible
trapped victims.
Vertical Ventilation initially relieves built-up heat and smoke even when conducted ahead
of an effective fire attack. However, this is a temporary improvement period that occurs
and may be followed by a rapid deterioration of conditions if hose line operation on the
fire does not occur at or near the same time. When properly coordinated with fire
extinguishment, vertical ventilation provides a needed and lifesaving benefit throughout
the fire building.
Vertical ventilation is best executed when sequenced simultaneous to and or immediately
following an effective fire attack. Coordination for vertical ventilation simply requires
communication between ventilation companies and fire attack companies. It is the
responsibility of fire attack companies to get water on the fire as quickly as possible from
the best position and to communicate when water is being flowed on the fire and
adequate knockdown has begun. It is the responsibility of ventilation companies to
ensure that water is being flowed onto the fire and that ventilation is needed.
Assumed or un-communicated expectations can place fire victims and Firefighters in
dangerous conditions. Ventilation in any manner will increase the available air in the fire
area and will make the fire conditions worse if not done in concert with effective water
application.
Vertical ventilation will be supervised and executed by fire companies operating in Roof
Sector. The objectives for Roof Sector when engaging in vertical ventilation operations
include:
•
•
•

Roof Sector must monitor the radio at all times.
Determining a safe working surface
Confirm the need for vertical ventilation in the incident action plan.

Coordinate the sequencing of vertical ventilation with interior fire attack crews.
Complete ventilation cuts to achieve effective ventilation over the fire
compartment.
Consider and coordinate roof fire control operations, as conditions and access
require.
Maintain roof-top monitoring of roof structure and fire conditions; during vertical
ventilation operation and exit the roof as soon as vertical ventilation objectives are
achieved.
Provide progress reports to Command.

When increased vertical ventilation is determined necessary, ventilation holes should not
be made larger. Once a standard-size ventilation hole is cut and cleared, the crews must
move away from that area. In some cases, more than one hole will be required to
sufficiently ventilate the structure. As one hole is opened, the Roof Sector should cut
additional holes a safe distance away. Crews must move from the first hole toward safer
areas with each consecutive ventilation hole. Time, roof structural integrity, and overall
effectiveness are critical factors in the consideration of additional ventilation holes.
Often, it is absolutely not necessary or with the additional risk. This must be coordinated
with Command.
It may be necessary to establish a Roof Sector in a position remote from the fire-involved
roof to keep a watchful eye on roof conditions, where imminent collapse will occur. Such
a location may be an elevated ladder platform or an adjacent building.
Commercial Roof Operations
Vertical ventilation on commercial buildings may not provide effective ventilation in the
same manner as on residential roofs due to the size of the compartments and the volume
of fuel. In non-compartmentalized large commercial structures, Roof Sector may not be
able to cut vertical ventilation holes large enough to positively impact the interior
conditions.
If a compartmentalized space can be identified inside a commercial occupancy and
ventilation is a necessary and reasonable consideration, vertical ventilation may be
warranted. This is conducted in a coordinated manner. In this instance, and when
increased vertical ventilation is determined necessary, ventilation holes should not be
made larger. Once a standard-size ventilation hole is cut and cleared, the crews must
move away from that area. As one hole is opened, the ventilation companies should cut
additional holes a safe distance away, if directly over the fire compartment. Crews must
move from the first hole towards safer areas with each consecutive ventilation hole.
Time, roof structural integrity, and overall effectiveness are critical factors in the
consideration of additional ventilation holes. Often, it is not necessary or worth the
additional risk. This must be coordinated with Command.

Attic Fires
Roof Sector should not consider vertically ventilating attic fires, especially ones that have
ventilation-limited smoke/fire conditions as their initial attack option. This includes fires
that begin in the attic or have extended into the attic. When heavy smoke and heat are
present in the attic space, the source of the fire and the extension into the attic need to be
extinguished at their source. Creating ventilation openings in a ventilation-limited
compartment (attic) can cause the smoke conditions to flash over. A coordinated fire
attack from the roof should be considered if interior crews are unable to apply water to
the attic or ventilation limited space.
Vertical Ventilation Communication
Company Officers managing roof operations must advise Command when ventilation
holes are completed and report on the fire conditions in the structure below the vent hole.
This report should include the following:
•
•

Fire and smoke conditions in the attic and through the vent hole
Any change in the roof conditions and/or structural stability

All Roof Sector personnel shall wear full protective clothing and equipment when
operating above a fire. SCBA face pieces and regulator must be worn while operating
above a fire, and remain in place through the decontamination process, when necessary.

12/19-SR

The Resource Sector is established as a supply pool to provide a standby supply of equipment for operating
sectors. The Resource Sector provides an identifiable location at which available supplies are assembled to
provide immediate support when required. Resource Sector is also responsible for having the immediate area
checked for equipment which may have been left at the scene upon termination of the incident.
POLICY
Command is responsible for identifying the need for establishment of a Resource Sector and assigning its
implementation. This requires the assignment of a Resource Sector Officer and sufficient personnel to operate
the Resource Sector as outlined below.
OPERATIONAL INFORMATION
The Resource Sector should be established in close proximity to the scene of operations, but outside of the
defined fireground/medical incident perimeter in a safe location.
For high-rise operations, the Resource Sector is normally established five floors below the on-deck floor or any
other safe, uncontaminated environment below the fire. Command may identify the location of the Resource
Sector or direct the assigned Resource Sector Officer to find and announce an appropriate location. The
Resource Sector Officer should locate an area large enough to meet the foreseeable needs of Resource Sector,
which may be much larger than initial needs would dictate (this will avoid congestion and the need to relocate).
The Resource Sector exists to provide support to operating sectors. This requires anticipation of equipment
and/or personnel which will be needed.
The Resource Sector Officer should attempt to identify the types of equipment and supplies which will be
required for the situation and provide delivery to the Resource Sector. This often involves moving tools and
equipment from apparatus in Staging to the Resource Sector. Typical supplies involved include spare air bottles,
hose, nozzles, hand tools, blowers, lights and loss control equipment. For major medical incidents; backboards,
c-collars, oxygen, and associated equipment should be assembled.
The Resource Sector will maintain an inventory of equipment and supplies at all times. The Resource Sector
Officer will assign sufficient personnel to provide for adequate support within the sector, including necessary
movement of equipment. Equipment areas in the resource pool should be grouped by type, denoting
equipment that is ready for use and equipment that is depleted.
In high-rise fires, the radio designation "Resource" should include the floor number that Resource is located on
(e.g., "Resource 25"). This will assist firefighting forces in locating Resource Sector within the building.
Communications will involve interaction with Command and Staging to provide supplies to the Resource Sector
(in a high-rise incident, Lobby Sector will also be involved). Operating sectors may obtain equipment by direct
communication with "Resource.”

It is the policy of the Phoenix Fire Department that no member will be permitted to continue emergency
operations beyond safe levels of physical or mental exertion. The intent of the Rehabilitation Sector is to
prevent the risk of injury that may result from extended field operations under adverse conditions.
PROCEDURE
The Rehabilitation Sector, radio designation REHAB, will be used to evaluate and assist personnel who could be
suffering from the effects of sustained physical or mental exertion during emergency operations. Rehab Sector
will provide a specific area where personnel will assemble to have:
1. Assessment of vital signs
2. Revitalization ‐ rest, hydration, refreshments, and temperature regulation
3. Medical evaluation and treatment of injuries, if needed
4. Transportation for those requiring treatment at medical facilities
5. Reassignment as needed
NOTE:
The Rehab Sector Officer is responsible for the accountability of crews assigned to Rehab Sector. Members
assigned to Rehab do not report back to their previously assigned sector. To be reassigned to another sector,
they must be assigned by Command after being cleared by Rehab.
A Rehab Team concept will be used wherever possible to establish and manage the Rehab Sector. This team
shall consist of:
1. Rehab Truck
2. Utility Truck
3. Rescue
4. ALS Company
5. Designated Sector Officer
6. C959, as needed
7. Health Center officer, as needed
A Rehab truck will be dispatched on all First Alarm and greater incidents, or when heat stress advisory is in
effect. It will be the responsibility of the Incident Commander to make an early determination of incidents
requiring Rehab Sector.
It may be necessary to establish more than one Rehab Sector. When this is done, each sector will assume a
geographic designation consistent with the location at the incident site, i.e. Rehab South, Rehab North.
City buses may also be called to the incident scene to provide cooling or shelter.
Rehab sector should be located in functional location for crew access. In smaller incidents, a utility truck may be
all that is required. It is the responsibility of the Rehab Sector Officer and/or Command to determine resources
for the sector.
The Rehab Sector area boundaries will be defined and will have only one entry point. It will be divided into the
following four Functions:

1

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

REHABILITATION SECTOR

M.P. 202.08

05/13-R

Page 2 of 4

Function A: Assessment
This is the initial entry point and assessment area. Members arriving at the entry point will remove their
Personal Protective Equipment prior to entry. Rehab Sector is responsible for the continuation of Accountability
and will assign a member to collect passports from crews and take a pulse rate on all crew members. The
purpose of this area is to identify any member who may be in need of more attention than just a recovery
period. If a member enters with no symptoms of overexertion and vitals in normal range, may return to duty
without further evaluation after REHAB. Any member who has a pulse rate greater than 120 will be recorded
and tracked thru the rehab sector. The member will proceed to rehydrate and rest with their crew members and
be re‐evaluated for pulse rate after 20 minutes. If a member enters Rehab with ALOC or irregular heartbeat they
will immediately receive ALS treatment. If after 20 minutes of rest and hydration the members pulse is still
above 120bbm or signs and symptoms of dehydration then they will receive ALS interventions based on
guidelines of Section C.
Function B: Hydration and Replenishment
Rehab personnel will provide supplemental cooling devices (active and/or passive cooling or warming as needed
for incident type and climate conditions, fluid and electrolyte replacement, and the proper amount of
nourishment.
Function C: Medical Treatment and Transport
ALS crews and a Rescue will manage this function. Here members will receive evaluation and treatment for over
exertion and injuries. The crews assigned will follow standard ALS Protocol and advise the Rehab Sector Officer
of the need for medical treatment and / or transportation requirements of personnel due to physical condition.
1. Vital Signs & Assessment Standards for REHAB: The ALS crew in this section will pay close attention to the
members:
Physical Observations:
1. Personnel complaining of chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, weakness,
nausea, or headache.
2. General complaints such as cramps, aches and pains, rate of perceived exertion
3. Symptoms of heat or cold related stress
4. Changes in gait, speech, or behavior
5. Alertness and orientation to person, place and time
6. Skin Color
7. Obvious Injuries
To be reassigned – Members must have:
A heart rate below 100 bpm with no irregular beats
Systolic BP below 160
Diastolic BP below 100
Respiratory rate between 12‐20 per minute
No abnormal neurological findings. (see below)
No complaints

b. Heart Rate Values (HRV) ‐normal resting pulse rate is between 60 and 100 bpm. At no time will an emergency
responder be allowed to return to duty until the pulse rate is below 100 beats per minute after 20 minutes of
rest. Members with a HRV over 100BPM after 20 minutes will receive ALS evaluation and treatment per standard
medical protocol.
c. Respiratory Rate (RR) ‐ normal value is a rate between 12‐20 breaths per minute. Before personnel are
returned to duty they should have a respiratory rate that falls within normal values. Persons with a persistent
respiratory rate greater than 20 breaths per minute after 20 minutes of rest shall receive ALS evaluation and
treatment per standard medical protocol.
d. Blood Pressure (BP) ‐ Upon recovery in rehabilitation a blood pressure should return to, or even be slightly
lower than their baseline. Personnel with a systolic pressure greater than 160 and / or a diastolic greater than
100 after 20 minutes in Rehab must go thru an ALS evaluation. Rehab sector will follow appropriate treatment
protocols based on the findings of the ALS evaluation.
e. Neurological Assessments‐ personnel not alert and oriented to person, place or time, and/ or who exhibit
changes in gait, speech or behavior, and/ or other persistent abnormal neurological findings shall receive ALS
evaluation and treatment per ALS protocols without waiting for the above mentioned 20 minute rest.
f. Skin and Body Temperature‐ The following skin symptoms require additional evaluation.
I. Heat Stress‐Personnel with skin that feels hot to the touch, dry, red, bumpy rash or is blistering.
II. Cold Stress‐ When skin is pressed turns red then purple, then white and is cold, looks waxy, feels
numb or has a prickly sensation are experiencing signs of frostbite.
III. Body Temperature‐ For personnel with body temperatures greater than 99.5F after 20 minutes may
be not returned to duty and will be transported to a hospital for further evaluation. (Note: Oral
measurements are approximately 1.0 degree F or 0.55 degree C lower than the normal Core Body
Temperature. Oral Temperatures are subject to error with tachypnea / hyperventilation. Tympanic
Measurements may be up to 2.0 degrees F or 1.1 degree C lower than core body temperature.) Cooling
measures as appropriate should be implemented.
h. Pulse Oximetry‐ Values must be above 92% or personnel will not be allowed to return to operations. Persons
with a persistent pulse oximeter value below 92% after 20 minutes of oxygen therapy and rest will receive ALS
evaluation and treatment per standard medical protocol. (Note: High readings may also be indicative of Carbon
Monoxide saturation. )
i. Blood Glucose/Sugar (BGS) ‐ will be assessed whenever abnormal neurological findings are observed. If
abnormal, treat as per PFD protocol.
j. Electrocardiogram (EKG) Monitoring and 12 Lead EKGs‐ Responders with a
persistent heart rate over 100 BPM after 20 minutes of rest shall receive a 12 lead EKG, ALS evaluation and
treatment as needed. Members with an irregular pulse will require ALS Treatment irregardless of time in Rehab
sector.

SECTION D: Documentation
Time‐in and time‐out for members/crews entering or leaving the rehabilitation area shall be tracked with vitals.
Any member requiring further evaluation beyond 20 min will be documented on an EMS patient care report.
Where emergency medical care is provided, an EMS Patient Care Report shall be generated and a copy placed in
the member’s employee health record.
SECTION E: Reassignment
On greater alarms, Health Center staff officer may be available in this section. This critical section determines a
crews’ readiness for reassignment. Diligent efforts and face‐to‐face communication with the Rehab Sector
Officer are required. Rehab crews will advise the Rehab Sector Officer of all companies’ status for reassignment
and crews that are running short or without a company officer. This information is relayed to Command by the
Rehab Sector Officer.
The Rehab Sector Officer will update Command throughout the operation with pertinent information including
the identities of companies in Rehab, the companies available for reassignment, and the status of injured
personnel off the tactical channel. All personnel leaving Rehab will retrieve passports from the Rehab Sector
Officer.
Company Officers must keep crews intact and report to Rehab. The Rehab Sector Officer will direct the crew on
arrival; however, it is the Company Officer’s responsibility to make sure crew members receive refreshments,
treatment if required, and rest and a medical clearance prior to re‐assignment or return to duty.

SUPPORT ACTIVITIES

M.P. 202.09

10/99-R

Page 1 of 2

Tactical support activities are those functions that assist active fire control and rescue operations. They
generally include forcible entry, ventilation and the provision of access. Most confusion on the
fireground is the result of lack of such support functions and does not generally relate to a breakdown
of basic water application activities. Command must cause these support functions to be completed in
a timely and effective manner--he/she must support the end of the nozzle. We lose most often
because of a lack of support, not a lack of water.
You ventilate a building principally for two reasons:
•
•

To prevent mushrooming
To gain (and maintain) entry

Vertical ventilation, as close to directly over the fire as possible, is the most effective form of ventilation
in working interior fire situations.
The timing of ventilation becomes extremely important and must be coordinated with fire attack
activities - ventilation should be provided in advance of attack lines. Portable radio communications
between engine and ladder companies facilitate this interaction.
Fire will naturally burn out of holes in roofs, regardless if you cut the hole or if the fire does. If the fire
burns through the roof (defensive ventilation), it will generally do so in the best location--directly over
the fire. If ladder companies cut the roof they must locate ventilation holes in a manner that will support
rescue activities and fire confinement. If vent holes are cut in the wrong places, the fire will naturally be
channelled to them and expand loss.
When you cut a hole in a roof, cut a big one.
We ventilate to alter interior conditions. The best operating position to determine if a building requires
ventilation and the location and timing of that ventilation is the interior sector. Interior and roof forces
must communicate in order to coordinate the effort effectively.
Do not operate hoselines, particularly ladder pipes, down ventilation holes. Be cautious of hoselines to
the roof--"candle moth" syndrome tends to overpower personnel operating on roofs when fire and
smoke come out vent holes. Operate roof lines only for the purpose of protecting personnel and
external exposures unless Command orders a coordinated roof attack.
Effective topside ventilation will tend to keep roofs intact longer and roof conditions become extremely
important to ventilation activities. If ladder crews cannot get on the roof to ventilate because of fire
conditions/roof profile, Command should consider this a marginal situation. Hose line crews can
probably get inside and stay inside longer than ladder crews can stay on the roof. Axiom: It is better to
abandon the building a bit too soon rather than a bit too late.

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Page 2 of 2

BOWSTRING TRUSS/ARCHED ROOF POLICY
For bowstring/arched roofs the policy is:
1. When fire is in the attic/truss space, and it is safe to do so, quickly search the building and
implement a defensive strategy.
2. When crews are unable to locate the fire, and it is safe to do so, quickly search the building and
implement a defensive strategy.
3. When fire involves a room and contents with no evidence of extension to the attic/truss space—
implement a quick, aggressive, offensive strategy.
RESIDENTIAL TILE ROOF POLICY
For interior and/or attic fires in single family residences with tiled roofs fire fighters are prohibited from
going to the roof. Any other structure with lightweight truss construction requires a careful evaluation of
fire conditions/roof profile prior to committing personnel to the roof.
Forcible entry involves a trade-off in time versus damage; the faster you force--the more damage you
do. The more critical the fire, the less important forcible entry damage becomes and vice versa. If the
fire is progressing and you must go in and attack from the unburned side, don't waste time trying to pick
the locks--bash the doors.
The provision of access many times will determine if the fire is cut off and extinguished or not. These
access-oriented activities generally involve pulling ceilings, opening up concealed spaces and voids,
and the activities required to get fire attack efforts in to operate on hidden fire. Such operations beat up
the fire building and must be done in a timely, well-placed manner. In such cases, do not hesitate--if
you size up fire working inside a concealed space, get ahead of it, open up and cut it off.
Beware of the premature opening of doors, holes, access efforts, etc. before lines are placed and
crews are ready to go inside. Good timing requires effective communication between engine and
ladder companies.

Attack Teams
11/14-R

12/19-SR

The purpose of this procedure is to give all firefighters an understanding of the Attack Team concept.
POLICY
Command should consider the value of deploying fire engine and ladder companies to build attack teams in the
incident command organization.
OPERATIONAL INFORMATION
In many tactical situations it is desirable to group companies together in Sectors to achieve more effective
results. This focuses the efforts of the companies toward tactical objectives and provides for a more
manageable incident. The Attack Team is an extension of this concept in which companies are assigned on the
fireground in groups to work toward a specific objective within a specific area. An Attack Team is an effective
operational group for many fireground tasks and provides a sound basis for the creation of sectors which may
be built upon as the incident progresses.
A standard Attack Team consists of two engine companies plus a ladder company. The basic grouping of two
engine companies and one ladder provides for adequate water supply and support capability to perform strong
tactical operations. A common deployment for an Attack Team involves a "forward" pumper supplied by one or
two lines from a "key" pumper on a hydrant. In most cases these "Teams" will be created by assigning individual
companies and adding resources as they become available. In other situations Command may be able to assign
a full Attack Team directly from Staging. The Attack Team will either report to an existing Sector Officer or will
become an additional Sector.
During the initial stages of an incident, Command should identify tactical requirements and consider assigning
Attack Teams to Sectors. An Attack Team assigned to establish a Sector should be able to perform as an
effective unit. Command should designate which officer will assume Sector responsibilities.

Purpose
The purpose of this document is to identify key strategic and tactical objectives in Phoenix
Regional operations in High-rise buildings. These include initial and ongoing building size-up,
appropriate use of the risk management profile, assessment of occupant location and removal,
and effective sectorazation within the incident structure. In the Phoenix Region, a high-rise
building is defined as 6 elevator stops or greater or 75 feet in height or greater.
It is important to understand that fighting a fire in a high-rise building is a complex operation
that must be based on a solid foundation of incident command and pre-fire attack support
sectors. A standard approach to fires in high-rise buildings will enhance our ability for a
successful operation. The omission of critical steps in the beginning of an incident can delay
suppression operations and risk the lives of firefighters and civilians within the building.
High-rise Building Size-up
•

•

•

Exterior view
• Often hide fire and smoke due to building being well sealed and large
internal capacity for smoke
• Determine if building is residential or commercial
• Estimate potential for falling debris and/or major structural collapse
• Guide responding companies around these hazards
Interior view
• Building personnel accounts
• Is building being evacuated?
• Alarm indications
• Stairwell identification
• Number of stairwells?
• Conditions within?
• Standpipe location?
• Roof access?
• How are they labeled?
• Have the elevators been recalled?
What resources are responding?
• Additional alarms needed based on observations?
• Consider a minimum 3rd alarm assignment in working high-rise fires

on to properly establish lobby operations and communications.
Create lobby staging area for crews
Locate freight elevator and determine if it is safe to use
If safe to use, assign crew members for proper roof escape hatch
preparation of the car, and a dedicated operator
• Elevators will not be used if smoke or water conditions
exist in the elevator hoist way
• If all elevators are down on the ground floor with doors
open on arrival, it is assumed there is smoke or fire in the
elevator mechanical room or the elevator hoistway and
the elevators should not be used.
Works directly with Command and level 2 staging on the staging
radio channel to direct fire companies in Lobby Sector to tactical
assignments
All companies on first 2 alarms should proceed directly to Lobby.
• This allows rapid deployment to sectors from within the
building
In a working fire, maintain a minimum of a 1st alarm of companies
in lobby at all times.
Crew accountability tracked based on assignment
• All crews ultimately should be tracked by Command
Manage lobby level elevator access
Assist with safe egress of evacuating occupants
Work with PD to prevent re-entry of evacuated occupants

required for the back up line to reach the same distance as the
initial attack line.

•

* 1 ¾ hose lines with automatic nozzles provide 150 gpm at best. 2” hand
lines operate effectively at lower psi’s typically seen in standpipe
operations and provide greater gpm of 250+ and increase stream reach.
2” and 2 ½” handlines also maintain the consistency of 2 ½” connections
for all standpipe operations and meets the NFPA 1710 standard of 500
gpm with two hose lines on the fire floor for high-rise firefighting.
• In-line pressure gauges connected at the standpipe should be
used when available to assure proper operating pressures to
individual hose lines and monitored by a dedicated crew member
to make pressure adjustments as needed.
• Stairwell protection with 2 ½ with smooth bore nozzle
Larger diameter hand line or master streams

LOSS CONTROL
04/95-R

Page 1 of 5

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to describe the process to reduce, and in many cases eliminate,
certain losses experienced during and following fires and other types of incidents.
INTRODUCTION
There is "value added" to the quality of service when firefighting includes loss control functions. Loss
control involves methods of minimizing loss in each of the tactical priorities through all phases of
firefighting. Throughout each of the three (3) tactical priorities, the safety and survival of firefighters,
customer service, and loss control functions are continuously addressed.
Search & Rescue = All clear
Fire Control = Fire under control
Property Conservation = Loss stopped
This procedure will discuss the elements of loss control and how they are integrated at emergency
incidents.
LOSS CONTROL
The loss experienced by the owners/occupants of a structure as a result of a fire is devastating.
Primary and secondary loss can be minimized through active loss control efforts. There are many
opportunities for effective loss control during property conservation, but the other two tactical priorities
(rescue and fire control) present significant loss control opportunities.
In addition to the psychological and emotional injuries our customers may suffer, the building suffers
the effects of fire including charring, water, smoke, structural, and content damage. The structure
becomes weakened by the fire. The building is unsecured and open to the elements of nature, as well
as open to looting. The ceiling and walls throughout the house are damaged by smoke. Furniture
receives water and smoke damage. Appliances (refrigerator) and swimming pools are without the
electricity they need to preserve food and clean the pool. Through effective loss control efforts we can
intervene in all aspects of the incident and take specific measures to minimize loss.
An important element of loss control is to extinguish the fire. Fighting the fire from the unburned portion
will effect loss control. This needs to be regularly reinforced with members. Fire attacks from the
burning portion will usually push heat and smoke through the building and increase loss.
Performing skills like forcible entry and ventilation should be done with loss control in mind.
Loss control may operate as a sector or a branch. When assigned as a branch, loss control may
include several sectors.

WATER DAMAGE
The most significant thing we can do to reduce damage is to put the fire out. As the fire travels so does
the damage. An aggressive interior attack may be the best step towards enhancing loss control efforts.
Yet knowing that water will do significant damage to dry wall, furniture, and carpeting, means we have
to control how much water is used. If possible, adjust the nozzle to allow for appropriate gallonage as
required in attack lines. Do not wet down the attic unnecessarily -- put the water directly on the fire and
burning embers. The use of class A foam in firefighting is another method of reducing water damage.
Water acts as a corrosive to pressed gypsum board (dry wall). It breaks the bond used in making the
board. Most of the houses and commercial structures we encounter will have gypsum board on the
walls and ceilings. When water is left to sit on gypsum board it will seep in and ruin the board.
Company officers and firefighters should be aware of the damage to drywall by direct water spray and
over spray. Reduce and eliminate over spray and it will minimize loss and water build up on the

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES
M.P. 202.12

LOSS CONTROL
04/95-R

Page 3 of 5

furniture. Standing water on wooden counter tops is also very damaging because it can cause
delamination, staining, and cracking. For loss control purposes, wipe off counter tops and table tops
with a dry towel not allowing water to sit and penetrate the surface. Furniture sitting in puddles of water
will be damaged. Water will migrate up the wooden legs of furniture or over stuffed material and cause
it to soak, crack, and stain. Place blocks under legs of the furniture to raise it up and out of the water.
If no blocks are available, canned goods from the home serve the same purpose and are an option.
Cover exposed furniture and other materials with salvage covers or plastic.
When water has filled the attic space and is pooling on the gypsum use a drill or a screwdriver as a
hole punch to allow the water to escape. Water sitting on the gypsum board will eventually seep
through; by drilling a small hole we can possibly save the ceiling and the hole is easily patched.
CARPETING/FLOOR COVERINGS
Water on carpeting in itself is damaging. It is made worse by soot and broken glass being ground in
when stepping on the carpet. Hall runners should be used to avoid staining and grinding in soot.
When a window is broken to make entry the glass on the carpet may cause the need for replacement,
especially if the glass is ground in. When possible throw a carry-all over the glass under the window to
prevent the grinding by foot steps. If debris is covering a relatively good carpet or flooring, it should be
shoveled out and swept off.
SMOKE DAMAGE
Unless interrupted, the hot smoke produced by fire will move throughout the structure. Positive
pressure ventilation (PPV) to clear the smoke is performed during active fire stages. After fire control,
closing or opening doors in the structure will help reduce smoke damage during ongoing ventilation
efforts.
Cutting a hole in the roof is also favorable. Rapid removal of smoke improves firefighters ability to
conduct search and rescue operations as well as effective fire control and salvage operations. Once
the fire is extinguished and the embers cooled it is necessary to exhaust smoke. Avoid blowing it
throughout the structure and continue to ventilate during overhaul. Take smoldering materials such as
a couch outside for overhaul.
When appropriate, turn off the ventilation system in the building. The AC system will expose the
remainder of the structure and might contaminate the air handling system (which could require its
replacement).
DRYWALL
Work to protect the structure. If possible, when checking for extension by pulling ceiling, do not pull
drywall from corners -- it may require that both walls and ceiling be replaced and cause additional loss.
Cut small inspection holes, preferably 6" x 6," to check attics. Remember that to relieve excess water
in the attic space and to reduce loss, drill drainage holes into the ceiling.

BUILDING PACKAGING
Just as we package a patient for transport in EMS we should also package a house or structure when
we're finished. Each room should be completely ventilated. This will reduce smoke damage. The
furniture should be covered with plastic. Water on counter tops and wooden furniture should be wiped
off. The furniture should be raised up (blocked) to prevent water damage. Excess debris should be
cleared off the floor. It will make the rooms look much cleaner and help alleviate the traumatic impact
of the fire for our customers. Debris should be brought outside, kept away from the entrance, be
covered with plastic, and anchored.
Customer valuables such as photo albums, video and audio tapes, clothing and other keepsakes found
in closets need to be carefully wrapped and placed in boxes. Contents of the box should be marked on
the outside for easier retrieval. Do not bag or box wet items. They will need time to dry before
packaging.
Access holes where ceilings were pulled, roofs, or walls that were opened should be "squared up" on
structural members except where special hazards are present (i.e., asbestos, etc.).
"Securing" the fire scene is also a function of loss control. Securing refers to actions required to protect
the structures and contents from damage or looting after fire companies have departed from the scene.
Roof ventilation holes and broken windows should be covered with plastic or other materials to reduce
weather damage and deter vandalism. The rolled plastic is ideal for this use. For safety reasons,
remaining glass shreds should be removed from the frames of broken windows prior to installing covers
and always prior to leaving the scene.
ADDITIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE ELEMENTS
Performing loss control is a mark toward excellence in service delivery. It is a "signature" of
professionalism in our craft. We should continually try to add quality and value to our work. In some
cases, where safe to do so, escorting the customer through the fire area can help him/her see and
visualize what we did and the need for overhaul operations. Also, proper loss control measures should
be completed prior to any walk through. Act like the place is yours and the people who own and
occupy it are your loved ones...This usually will lead us in the right direction.
In many cases, wearing dirty turnouts into a home on EMS or service calls can soil the furnishings. By
keeping our turnouts clean, we could avoid unnecessary damage to
flooring, walls or furniture. Simply hose off boots and pants after each fire call to eliminate or minimize
loss created by dirty turnouts. This will also help to keep them decontaminated.
Loss control measures may have to be suspended due to fire investigation needs. In this case, fire
companies may have to return after the fire investigation to complete loss control activities.
Companies should select an appropriate location for outside piles of debris. Debris in high travel areas
should be avoided. Minimize trauma to the customer by helping to make the scene appear less
devastating.

Part of the customer service effort is managing our conduct and behavior appropriately. We should be
on our best behavior when working on the emergency scene.
The pets we encounter are, often times, considered by the owners a part of the family. While our
primary mission is for the protection and care of people, we should attempt to provide an appropriate
level of care and respect to animals in distress. Whenever feasible and safe to do so and as part of our
commitment to customer service, we should display an open, caring concern for pets and animals when
dealing with a full range of situations.
On larger incidents loss control will be a significant part of the operation and additional
resources/alarms may be necessary to insure the effectiveness of loss control efforts.
Loss control efforts will increase the value our customers place on our work. There is no question that
we should strive to improve our services. Loss control is an area where we can always improve.

PURPOSE
This procedure describes guidelines for conducting salvage operations. Virtually every fire, small
or large, produces a need for some form of salvage operations. Salvage includes activities
required to stop direct and indirect fire damage as well as those actions to reasonably mitigate
the effects of firefighting operations. This includes losses from water, smoke, and other firefighting
efforts. Salvage operations should be aimed at controlling loss by reasonable expedient means.
Salvage objectives are:
• To reasonably stop or reduce the sources of damage
• To reasonably protect or remove contents
Command will provide for salvage at all fires or other incidents posing potential damage to
property.
Salvage operations most often involve early smoke removal and covering building contents with
salvage covers or plastic. In some cases, the contents of all threatened areas can be removed to a
safe location. When removal is not practical, contents should be grouped in the center of rooms,
raised off of the floor and covered to provide maximum practical protection.
The following items should be considered when addressing salvage:
• Type, value and location of contents
• The extent and location of the fire
• Recognition of existing and potential damage sources
• Estimate of required resource

SALVAGE
Page 1 of 2

EXTENT AND LOCATION OF FIRE
Salvage efforts should begin in areas most severely threatened by damage. In most cases that will
be areas directly adjacent to or below the fire area. Additional salvage activities can expand
outward until all areas of potential loss are secured.
RECOGNITION OF EXISTING AND POTENTIAL DAMAGE SOURCES
All firefighting activities have the potential to damage property and contents. The key to successful
salvage is to distinguish between excessive damage, and damage that is required to reduce
potential fire damage. Reasonable loss control activities should be balanced to reduce the
potential damage incurred during firefighting activities.
TYPE, VALUE AND LOCATION OF CONTENTS
Replacement price and value should be the primary considerations when performing salvage
operations. It is often difficult to separate value from price. Salvage crews should consider both
the worth (value) of items and dollar cost. For example, business records, may have extremely
high value to business owners while their actual price represents only the paper they are printed
on. Pictures, wall paintings, family mementos, etc., may have very high personal value to the
property owner.
ESTIMATE OF REQUIRED RESOURCE
An early request for manpower and salvage equipment can significantly reduce loss. The first
company assigned to salvage should consider the size-up factors and request sufficient resources
to stabilize the situation.
SALVAGE EQUIPMENT
Common salvage equipment includes salvage covers and boxes, rolled plastic, hall runners,
brooms and squeegees.
CUSTOMER SERVICE
Command and/or the Sector Officer should meet with the property owner or responsible party
when available to determine/identify the salvage priorities. The earlier this can be done, the
greater the opportunity to identify high value/priority items or areas. In some cases, when safe to
do so, allowing the property owner/occupant to be escorted through the building by Fire
Department personnel can be of great assistance to the loss control operation.

PURPOSE
This procedure establishes guidelines for conducting overhaul operations. While it is impossible
to completely eliminate the chances of secondary fires, the goal of overhaul is to reduce the
incidence of secondary fires, control loss, and stabilize the incident scene while providing for
firefighter safety, preserve evidence, and secure the fire scene.
DEFINITIONS
Cellulose Insulation: Finely ground, recycled newspaper with a chemical additive to increase fire
resistance. Cellulose insulation is typically mechanically blown into an empty space of a structure
to provide insulation.
Overhaul: A fire-fighting term involving the search for hidden fires and other indicators of fire, and
the assessment of final extinguishment after the main body of fire has been knocked down. The
goal of Overhaul is to make reasonable efforts to reduce the possibility of a subsequent fire caused
by the return to flaming combustion of the original fire or by any other ignition source.
Rekindle: A subsequent fire in a building, structure, pile of debris, or other, where a recent fire was
previously extinguished.
Note: Even when reasonable efforts are performed, overhaul may not eliminate all the risks of
rekindle; however, it will reduce the possibility. A rekindle is not always and should not be
considered per se evidence of a return to flaming combustion of the original fire.
Effective overhaul activities help reduce the potential for secondary fires. When addressing
overhaul operations, the Incident Commander (IC) should make reasonable efforts to:

OVERHAUL
Page 1 of 4

•

•
•

•
•
•

Ensure overhaul is conducted safely. This includes, but is not limited to, following the SOPs
for Fireground Exposure Reduction (206.02) and Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus
(202.05B).
Ensure allied equipment (Thermal Imaging Camera, foam applicator, etc.) are utilized when
necessary.
Use early and continuing positive pressure ventilation to maintain an acceptable working
environment and reduce loss. Fire companies must evaluate and monitor conditions when
operating fans.
Meet with the property owner/occupant concerning overhaul operations.
Schedule fire companies to conduct post-incident drive-by/walk-through of fire building to
check for potential re-ignition sources.
Coordinate overhaul with fire investigators.

CUSTOMER RELATIONS
In the absence of an occupant services sector, the IC, or the company officer should meet with the
property owner/occupant to explain the reasons for overhaul operations. Where it is reasonably
safe to do so, the IC, or the company officer, may escort the property owner/occupant through the
fire area to explain the need for overhaul operations. Proper loss control/salvage operations
should be completed prior to any walk-through. Providing the property owner/occupant the
opportunity to remove personal possessions/valuables or assisting them in boxing and removing
these items is excellent customer service and a loss control opportunity.
Reasonable efforts should also be made to assist the property owner/occupant in notifying
insurance agents of the fire.
HIDDEN FIRES
Reasonable fire suppression operations might not detect and extinguish small pockets of fire
concealed in construction voids or hidden under debris. Overhaul activities include searching the
fire scene to detect and extinguish hidden fires or "hot spots." Suppression crews should open as
many of these construction voids as reasonably possible. Floor, wall or ceiling areas showing
evidence of extensive decomposition due to fire should be thoroughly examined during overhaul.
Additional areas to check include wooden door jambs, air conditioning vents and registers,
baseboards, door and window casings, metal to wood connections, ties, straps, conduits, and
areas around light fixtures and electrical outlets. TICs, foam applicators, axes, pike poles, and
Halligan tools are most commonly used for this purpose. Although a TIC may not be able to detect
small hot spots, it can nonetheless be a valuable tool when looking for hidden fire/hot spots. Foam
application during overhaul cannot guarantee complete suppression of all materials.
Attic fires can pose a special hazard for secondary fires where insulation has been exposed to fire.
Large areas can receive fire damage and can be located in difficult to reach areas. In some cases,
insulation should be reasonably removed to extinguish all remnants of fire. It is understood that
OVERHAUL
Page 2 of 4

there is no possible way for firefighters to completely remove all insulation (especially cellulose
insulation). Removing insulation in many cases means removal of large sections of ceiling. If
possible, a reasonable risk/benefit discussion should be conducted with the owner/occupant to
discuss the extent of insulation removal. The department cannot be held responsible for
secondary fires if owner/occupants understand the risks associated with limited insulation
removal. Plenum spaces, soffits and pipe chases should receive careful inspection as they provide
possible routes for fire to spread throughout a structure. Some construction features do not allow
this.
The IC is responsible for ensuring that the fire area has been reasonably overhauled. The company
officer last leaving the scene is responsible for fire extinguishment, when possible. The IC is
further responsible for scheduling post-incident drive-by/walk-through inspections of the fire
building when needed. Post-incident inspections include a walkthrough of the building or areas
when safe to enter. Crews should search for evidence of smoke or remaining hot spots. Crews
should examine materials below salvage covers. In some cases, crews may need to create
additional openings in the structure. A post incident inspection will be performed prior to the last
fire department unit leaving the scene. The IC is responsible for assessing the need for additional
post incident inspections and coordinating the plan with Dispatch & Deployment. A reasonable
period of post-incident inspections may be scheduled to prevent secondary fires in buildings that
contain cellulose insulation. The IC may waive post incident inspections if a fire watch is in place.
If The IC believes the circumstances warrant a fire watch, C99 should be dispatched to the incident.
C99 will meet with the building owner/occupant so that the owner/occupant understands Fire Code
requirements including fire watch qualifications and cost, and to ensure that the owner/occupant
complies with the Fire Code.
CELLULOSE INSULATION FIRES
Cellulose insulation, which is one of the most commonly used insulation types, has been used in
structures for several years. When exposed to heat, sparks or flames, cellulose insulation presents
special problems for the fire service, businesses, and building owners/occupants. Hot spots can
get buried deep inside cellulose insulation where they can lie before breaking into fire. Fire
companies at structure fires that have cellulose insulation should:
• Follow standard operating procedures for obtaining all clear and fire control.
• Identify cellulose insulation as soon as possible.
• Evaluate the use of fans based on the presence of cellulose insulation.
• Follow standard overhaul procedures contained in this M.P.
• While it is widely recognized that it is impossible to remove all cellulose insulation and
impossible to absolutely prevent all secondary fires or rekindles of a structure, fire
companies should remove or wet down as much insulation as reasonably possible.
• Have utility companies pull the electrical meter and ensure other utilities are secured.
• Meet with the owner/occupant and the fire investigator to advise the owner/occupant that
they should not occupy the structure.
OVERHAUL
Page 3 of 4

DEFENSIVE FIRES
Overhaul activities as described above will not be conducted on structures that have been declared
Defensive Fires. Firefighter safety prohibits standard overhaul activities in structurally
compromised buildings. Crews will continue to apply water to hidden fire/hot spots from exterior
positions until all fire is completely extinguished. During campaign operations, the IC will
coordinate the rotation of crews through Dispatch & Deployment.
EVIDENCE PRESERVATION
Companies performing overhaul should compare the importance of preserving evidence to the
danger of immediately removing debris and extinguishing all traces of fire. In some cases, it may
be necessary to monitor spot fires until investigators arrive on the scene. In these instances, and
when possible, evidence should remain untouched, undisturbed and in its original location.
Where circumstances prohibit this, evidence should be removed under the direction of a fire
investigator.
SECURING THE FIRE SCENE
Securing the fire scene is also a function of overhaul. Securing refers to actions required to protect
the structure and contents from further loss after fire suppression companies have left the scene.
Roof ventilation holes and broken windows should be covered to reduce weather damage and
deter vandalism. Rolled plastic is ideal for this purpose. For safety reasons, reasonable efforts
should be made to remove remaining glass shards from the frames of broken windows prior to
installing covers or leaving the scene.
Securing the scene also includes the actions required to address the safety of all persons likely to
visit the incident scene. Once a hazard zone is established during firefighting operations, it must
not be abandoned prior to removing or stabilizing the hazard. Overhaul companies should provide
means of identifying and guarding hazards that cannot be removed or stabilized. Reasonable
efforts, including, but not limited to barricades, hazard tape, and the posting of guards are all
methods depending upon severity.

The purpose of this procedure is to establish the role and responsibilities of the Occupant Services
Sector.
The Occupant Services Sector shall be established by the Incident Commander at all working structure
fires, and as early in the incident as is practical. The Occupant Services Sector should also be
established at any incident where the need is identified; Fire, EMS, Special Operations, etc.
The Occupant Sector is a critical extension of our service delivery, and serves as the liaison between
the Fire Department and those citizens (responsible parties) directly, or perhaps indirectly involved in or
affected by the incident.
If necessary, Command will request additional resource in order to establish the Occupant Services
Sector. An additional engine, ladder, or battalion chief is acceptable. If necessary, at prolonged
incidents, in order to return fire companies and personnel to service, Command may assign staff
personnel to this function. The Occupant Services Sector responsibilities may extend beyond the
termination of the incident.
RESPONSIBILITIES:
The Occupant Services Sector should consider offering the following services to the
occupant/responsible parties. It should be noted that other occupant service needs may be identified
and should be addressed as part of the Department's customer service goals.

Carry out responsibilities under supervision of loss control officer.
Explain what happened, what we are doing and why, how long we expect to take until the
incident is under control.
Obtain from occupant/responsible party, any significant information regarding the structure
and/or its contents that might assist Command tactically with the operation. Inform Command of
this information.
Provide cellular telephone access.
Communicate the location to which evacuees have been sent. (Notify the Investigations Sector
of this location also when passing on this information.)
Identify any mental health needs of occupants/responsible party's, as well as any spectators or
evacuees. (i.e., affects of shootings, mass casualty, highly visible critical rescue, etc).
Notify Red Cross, Salvation Army, or other relief agencies.

needed.

The Occupant Services Sector shall report to Command unless a loss control Branch/Section is
assigned, at which time he/she shall report to the loss control officer.
MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS
Occasionally, the public is witness to a critical life threatening event that can have substantial
psychological impacts on them. These persons may be survivors of a critical event or a witness to a
mass casualty, or a parent of a severely injured child, or a witness to the death of a family member, etc.
Additionally, witnesses may have misunderstandings of fire department operations that cause a delay
in removal of the patient (i.e. trench collapse, an electrocution rescue that is delayed due to energized
contact, etc.). Addressing these issues early, on-site, or as soon as possible following the event, can
minimize these misunderstandings, and reduce psychological effects, and produce improved relations
with the public.
The Occupant Services Sector should consider additional help for these needs. Assistance and advice
on availability of mental health services can be obtained through the department's Critical Incident
Debriefing Team, the Employee Assistance Program Contractor, the American Red Cross, and in some
cases, through the victim's personal medical insurance. Support from the Fire Department Chaplain or
local clergy may also be available.
AMERICAN RED CROSS SERVICES
For residential fires where the occupant has suffered a loss of living quarters and clothing, the
American Red Cross may be used to provide support.
The American Red Cross can provide some clothing, food, toiletries, and arrange for temporary
shelter/housing for the occupants. When contacting the Red Cross, provide the following information:
•
•
•
•
•

Address of the incident.
Address where victims can be contacted.

PURPOSE
To provide guidelines for determining water supply needs and selecting the most effective hose
line size or sizes based upon initial and ongoing size-up and fire ground factors.
OVERVIEW
Adequate water supply during fire attack operations has a critical impact on fire control outcomes.
Water on the fire as quickly as possible improves the tenability of potential victims and improves
conditions for firefighters to operate. An uninterrupted water supply is necessary to sustain
effective water volumes during a fire attack in all critical tactical positions. An ineffective fire attack
with inadequate water volume leads to delayed fire control, increased risk to firefighters and
victims, and greater fire loss.
HYDRANT WATER SUPPLY
First due engine companies approaching the scene with any evidence of a working fire should
secure a water supply. Exceptions to this guideline may include:
• Known or highly suspected rescue requiring a full crew
• Unsure of actual fire location in multi-unit residential or commercial building complex
• Fire in a high-rise building
Hillside or remote custom homes, junkyards, re-cycle or mulch facilities, high fire-load
occupancies, and limited hydrants require pre-planning for unique hose-lays, drafting from canals,
or extremely long supply lines.
Adequate water supply lines must be considered to all tactical positions that fire companies are
working from. This includes interior or exterior fire attacks from hose lines and/or master streams.
The number of supply lines and configuration of forward and key pumpers in any tactical position
WATER SUPPLY AND FIRE STREAM MANAGEMENT
Page 1 of 7

will be determined by the water supply needs established by the incident action plan. This can be
accomplished through “big water” evolutions, tandem pumping, and/or relay pumping
operations. These will be determined by hydrant/water supply availability and the distances
between the water supply and position of the fire attack.
Supply lines must be laid with consideration for access problems they create. When possible, lay
the supply hose along the hydrant-side of the roadway and cross over at the fire if necessary. Slow
down when laying lines, faster speeds result in excess hose on the roadway. Slower speeds also
provide several advantages:
• Reduces the risk of striking pedestrians or vehicles or firefighters.
• Provides time for the Company Officer to size-up and evaluate critical fire ground factors.
• Provides time for the Engineer to appropriately spot the apparatus.
PUMPED WATER
After initial arriving companies have established an adequate water supply, subsequent arriving
companies should stage in a manner to be easily assigned as a key pumper in critical tactical
positions. Providing key pumpers on hydrants enhances fire ground safety in several ways:
• Ensures an uninterrupted water supply
• Provides volume when needed for extremely long supply lines (e.g., apartment’s, re-cycling
facilities or areas with limited water mains & hydrants)
• Ability to pump water through the forward pumper in the event of mechanical failure
Pumped water supply (Humat Valve Operation) is critical when large volumes of water are
required in any tactical position. This provides for adequate water volume in attack operations
including engine company mounted master streams, ladder pipes, or multiple high volume (2”
and/or 2.5”) attack lines are in operation.
Generally, first alarm companies should lay their own supply lines when establishing any tactical
position before pumped water is considered/needed. In most cases, an unsupported forward
supply lay of 500 feet of 4” supply line can flow 800 GPM. Most initial attack operations, including
engine mounted master stream operations can be adequately supplied without pumped water for
initial fire attack operations.
In most cases, the need for pumped water occurs once initial fire attack operations have been
established. Command and/or Sector Officers should address the need for pumped water as
ladder pipes or multiple Engine Mounted Master Streams are ordered into operation.
MASTER STREAM SUPPLY LINES
When establishing supply lines for master stream operations it is necessary to provide standard
“big water” hose evolutions to provide adequate water volumes for ladder companies. Aerial
apparatus typically can flow 1000 gpm per deck gun. Most aerial platforms have 2 deck guns
WATER SUPPLY AND FIRE STREAM MANAGEMENT
Page 2 of 7

(capable of 1000 gpm per deck gun). Aerial platforms or aerial ladders should be considered 1000
plus gpm appliances.
Standard “big water” evolutions include a forward and key pumper, 2 supply lines between the
forward and key pumper, and pumped water by the key pumper supplying the 2 supply lines. The
forward pumper must be positioned as close to the ladder company as possible to diminish the
length of supply line from the forward pumper to the ladder company inlets. The “big water”
evolution can be conducted in a few different manner’s dependent on available apparatus. The
most efficient manner includes the forward pumper completing a forward lay from the hydrant to
the ladder company. The key pumper then completes a reverse lay from the forward pumper to
the hydrant with a second supply line.
ATTACK HOSE LINE CHOICE
The objective of the attack hose line choice is to provide enough water volume and reach to
overcome the heat energy and heat release rate of the fire or an adequate flow to effectively cool
and protect exposures.
BASIC ATTACK HOSE LINE PLACEMENT
When operating in the offensive strategy, fire attack hose lines of adequate water volume should
be used to put water on the fire and/or onto burning compartment surfaces as quickly as possible.
They should also be used to control access to hallways, stairways, or other vertical and horizontal
channels through which people and fire travel.
• The first water stream should be placed to extinguish and/or cool the most endangered
interior compartments from the most advantageous position (interior or exterior) to best
impact tenability of victims and/or firefighters conducting rescue efforts.
• When no victims are present, the water stream should be placed on the fire with adequate
volumes to attempt to suppress the fire and attempt to limit the spread to exposures.
• When immediate exposures are present, water streams should be directed on the
exposures as early as possible.
• Back up hose lines should be deployed to protect a means of egress when necessary
(always bear in mind the presence of Fire personnel operating in opposing positions).
• Back up lines should be of the same or greater water volumes when possible.
When a change from offensive to defensive operation occurs, crews should pull hand lines out of
the fire building only if safe to do so. Do not delay exiting the building for the sake of salvaging a
few feet of hose and a nozzle if conditions are deteriorating rapidly unless the line is needed for
crew protection during egress operations.
FIRE STREAM CHARACTERISTICS AND CONSIDERATIONS
Fire companies must consider the characteristics of fire streams and choose the most effective
nozzle and stream for the volume of fire and the size of the fire compartment(s).
WATER SUPPLY AND FIRE STREAM MANAGEMENT
Page 3 of 7

Solid or straight stream:
• Greater penetration
• Greater reach
• Greater striking power
• Greater cooling of interior surfaces
• Greater cooling of exposed spaces
• Less steam conversion
Fog pattern (narrow, medium, wide)
• Shorter reach
• Smaller water droplets
• Greater air entrainment
• Greater steam production
• Most effective in confined spaces such as attics
The current hose and nozzle packages that are carried on Phoenix Fire Engine Companies include:
• 1 ¾” hose line with automatic nozzles (x2 minimum)
o Hose lengths include:
 150’ crosslay
 200’ crosslay
o 100’ to 150’ front bumper line
• Automatic nozzle (75 psi nozzle pressure for 70 to 200 GPM)
o 2” hoseline with smooth bore nozzles (x1)
o Hose length:
 200’ crosslay or rear mount depending on apparatus configuration
o Smooth bore nozzles with 1 1/16” tip (260 GPM at 60 psi nozzle pressure)
• 2 ½” hose line with smooth bore nozzles (1 or 2 depending on apparatus configuration)
o Hose length:
 200’ rear mount (1 or 2 depending on apparatus configuration)
o Smooth bore nozzle with 1 3/16” tip (265 GPM at 40 psi nozzle pressure)
o Blitz Monitor with solid bore or peripheral tips (up to 500 GPM)
FIRE STREAM CONSIDERATIONS – OFFENSIVE STRATEGY
An offensive fire attack should be centered on knocking the fire down and cooling the interior
spaces to improve tenability for victims and improve working conditions of searching firefighters.
When an initial attack does not control the fire completely, some considerations must be made. It
must be determined if the fire simply requires more water to overcome the heat energy and/or
does the fire attack additionally need to come from alternate position(s) (either interior or
exterior)?

WATER SUPPLY AND FIRE STREAM MANAGEMENT
Page 4 of 7

Through fire behavior research it has been clearly identified that fire is most effectively
extinguished by water on the interior surfaces of a burning compartment, room, or space to cool
the interior temperatures initially and then water on to the burning fuels directly. This is most
effectively done with a straight or solid bore stream to keep the water droplets from the hose
stream as large as possible. This limits the potential for steam production and creates cooling of
the interior environment that tends to contract the hot gases. This is most effective in smaller
residential spaces that allow for better water application on the interior surfaces from the most
advantageous position. The same principals are true for commercial occupancies however due to
size and complexity; it becomes significantly more difficult.
For fires that begin on the exterior of a building or occupancy, the fire attack should begin on the
exterior fire and move to the interior. If an interior attack is initiated without controlling the exterior
fire, the interior fire will continue to be fed from that exterior fire. A simultaneous fire attack on
the exterior and interior spaces is the most effective means when possible.
Early identification of the direction of a flow path at a structure fire allows Firefighters to determine
the best method of fire attack to work within the intake portion of the flow path, rather than against
it. This may not always be possible and when the only option for Firefighters is to make a fire
attack from the exhaust portion of the flow path, extreme caution must be taken. Considerations
for changing the ventilation profile may change the direction of the flow path and create favorable
conditions to begin a fire attack. It’s critical that any changes that impact the ventilation profile are
well coordinated.

UL-FSRI Flow Path and Suppression Must Be Considered Together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7k7_F2lowg
When wind conditions are present, it is safest to initiate the fire attack with the wind at the back of
Firefighters. When wind driven conditions are present during an interior fire attack, extreme
caution must be taken to control the ventilation intake, if on the windward side. Uncontrolled
ventilation intake during wind driven conditions has created deadly conditions for Firefighters
across the country. It must be identified and avoided.
UL-FSRI Keep the Wind at Your Back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3hF14iNec8
Backing up an initial fire attack is an important consideration. Backing up an initial attack must be
conducted with hose streams/water volumes that match or exceed the initial hose line.

WATER SUPPLY AND FIRE STREAM MANAGEMENT
Page 5 of 7

Beware of hose lines that have been operated in the same place for long periods. Fire conditions
change during the course of fire operations (most things will only burn for a limited time) and the
effect of hose line operations must be continually evaluated. If the operation of such lines becomes
ineffective, move, adjust, or redeploy them.
Beware of the limitations of operating nozzles through small openings in to confined spaces such
as attic spaces, truss lofts, cocklofts, or mansard style roof. The mobility of such streams is limited,
and it is generally difficult to get water on the interior surfaces. Fire streams from above a confined
space makes it very difficult to get water on the underside and structural components for the most
effective surface cooling. Sometimes buildings or conditions will require fire companies to breach
walls/floors to apply water to a burning space. It is important to realize the potential limitations.
Basement fires are most effectively extinguished when the water is applied from the same level
as the fire. Basements with man-door access allow for the most effective water application on the
interior surfaces from as steep an angle as possible, in the same manner as any other interior
space. Basements with no exterior access or partial access from ground level windows creates a
challenge for water application. Water must be applied from the most advantageous exterior
position, through the windows (when possible) to cool the interior environment to allow interior
access. If no exterior access is possible, extreme caution must be exercised as the only access to
the lower level/basement will be through the flow path (chimney) from the floor above. All
possible actions must be exercised to attempt to cool the interior environment prior to making
access.

Company Officers and Sector Officers must assume responsibility for the effectiveness of their fire
streams. These officers must maintain an awareness of where fire streams are going, their
effectiveness, and then report the general operational characteristics back to the Sector Officer or
Command. Company Officers must understand and be competent with the nozzle characteristics
and features of the operating nozzles to get the most effective volume and stream while operating
on the fireground.
FIRE STREAM CONSIDERATIONS – DEFENSIVE STRATEGY
When master streams are needed for large volumes of water to slow fire growth, extinguishment,
or to protect exposures, they must be used with deliberate understanding of their strengths and
challenges. Master streams should be used for large volumes of fire or to protect exposures that
require large volumes of water to do so. They can certainly provide up to 1000+ gpm. That can
WATER SUPPLY AND FIRE STREAM MANAGEMENT
Page 6 of 7

provide significant surface cooling however that comes with powerful striking force and
significant water weight (1000 gpm = 8,340 pounds of water per minute and 139 pounds of water
per second). This can have adverse effects on structural stability immediately and over time.
Exterior master streams should not be used with interior operations in the same structure or
occupancy depending on the building type. The exception to this would be a defensive strategy
while protecting exposures from interior positions at structure fires where these tactics are
applicable from the perspective of risk management. It is possible to flow master streams in the
fire occupancy while working with handlines from interior positions to protect exposures in other
occupancies after a thorough size up and determination of structural stability. Command and
Sector Officers must closely coordinate any exterior master streams with interior operations or
personnel operating nearby.
Master streams may be useful in knocking down a large body of fire in a segment of a structure
where the intent is to operate in offensive positions after significant knockdown is achieved.
Command and the Sector Officers must evaluate the structure’s stability in these situations. This
evaluation should occur after the master streams are shut down and BEFORE committing crews
to interior positions. When there is any question as to the stability of the structure crews should
not be deployed to interior positions.
When there is a change in strategy from Offensive to Defensive, Command must prioritize hand
line operations. Large volume hand lines such as 2.5” and 2” lines may be used to protect
exposures from defensive positions outside of the hazard zone. Smaller (1 ¾”) hand lines should
be shut down after changing to a defensive operation. Pump operators should close the
discharges to these lines to prevent well-meaning firefighters from trying to use hand lines where
they are ineffective and allow Firefighters to creep into the hazard zone. Command and sector
officers must maintain all members in positions outside the collapse zone and prevent firefighters
from moving into unsafe positions.

OBJECTIVE
The objective of this procedure is to provide field personnel with guidance in handling pets and
other animals that are encountered as a result of an EMS, fire or other response. These pets or
animals may require medical attention and the RP is unknown or unable to care for the animal, or
the animal presents a danger to the general public. The pets or animals we encounter might also
be trapped or injured.
The pets that we encounter are often times considered by the owners a part of the family. While
our primary mission is for the protection and care of people, we should attempt to provide some
level of care to animals in distress whenever feasible and safe to do so as a part of our
commitment to customer service. We should display an open, caring concern for pets and
animals when we deal with the public in these types of situations.
SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
Caution should be used in approaching any animal, especially one that is injured. At no time is
the safety of our members or that of the public to be compromised by attempting to capture an
animal. If there is any doubt, contact one of the agencies listed in this procedure and request that
they respond. When dealing with pet or animal rescues, they should be handled similar to
"property" when evaluating the risk/gain profile of the incident.
HANDLING PETS
Rescue Efforts (fires, trapped or injured pets)
Rescuing pets or animals during an incident should take the same priority as any loss control
activity. An evaluation should be made in terms of the risk or exposure that our personnel would
face, versus the likelihood of a positive outcome.
Treatment of Injuries
Animal injuries can be treated in a similar manner as BLS injuries to a human. For example,
bleeding can be controlled by direct pressure, elevation and bandaging. Burns can be cooled with
water. Oxygen can be administered for breathing difficulties. Broken limbs can be stabilized
using splints. At no time, however, should any attempt be made to provide fluids intravenously.
Caring Attitude/Empathy
We should realize that to many people, an animal or pet is considered a family member. We
should attempt to treat their concerns with empathy and demonstrate a caring attitude towards
their concern. In addition, if the incident has resulted in the death of an animal, we should
attempt to assist them in the disposal of the animal by contacting the proper agency, such as the
Humane Society or the ASPCA for guidance.
If there is any question regarding the handling or care of a pet, any of the agencies listed in CAD
are more than willing to provide guidance and assistance. They all stated that if they are not able
to help, they will put us in touch with the proper agency. A case in point may be in the situation
where we have treated and transported a rider who has fallen from a horse--what do we do with
the horse? The proper agency in this case is Arizona Livestock, but ASPCA stated that they may
be able to provide assistance in securing the animal until further action can be taken.

CONTACT NUMBERS
Whenever there is any question regarding handling an injured, non-injured, stray or trapped
animal, both the Humane Society and the AZ Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals are
willing to either provide direct assistance, or serve as a clearing house in directing us to the proper
agency or veterinary service. Both have 24 hour hotlines listed in CAD. To access this
information by MDT, type MDTINFO ANIMALS.
Stray animals
For stray, uninjured animals, the call should be referred to the Maricopa County Animal Control
(for the telephone number, see "MDTINFO ANIMALS" in the CAD system).
Injured animals
The two primary agencies that can be contacted to respond to injured animal calls (where the
animal is not a threat to human safety) are:
Humane Society
AZ Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
(both numbers are in CAD under "MDTINFO ANIMALS")
Both agencies have personnel available 24 hours a day and will respond valley-wide when
requested. In the event that they are not able to handle the particular animal involved (for
example, an exotic animal) they will provide you with the proper agency to contact for assistance.
If it is necessary to move an injured animal out of a roadway, the recommended procedure is to
wrap the animal in a blanket and immobilize it before moving it. Muzzling the animal with material
such as kling or a PackStrap would be suggested. This will help to minimize the danger to the
rescuers.
ANIMAL RESCUE (NON-EMERGENCY)
In the event that you should encounter an animal that is in distress, but is not injured (cat-in-tree
type of call, contact the following agencies (the telephone numbers are in CAD under "MDTINFO
ANIMALS"):
Humane Society
AZ Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
If they are unable to provide timely assistance, they will direct you to an agency that can help.
DANGEROUS ANIMALS
When there is a danger to human safety, Animal Control will respond. (Also request that PD
respond.) Their telephone number can be accessed on the CAD via "MDTINFO ANIMALS."
Responders should take actions to ensure that the safety of the public and Department members
is not compromised while waiting for the arrival of Animal Control.

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN IF THE ANIMALS LIFE IS IN DANGER
If an animal is injured to such an extent that its life is in danger, at the discretion of the ranking
fire department officer, the animal may be transported to a veterinarian for emergency care.
There is a list of emergency animal clinics listed in the CAD under "MDTINFO ANIMALS." The
cost for this treatment will either be passed on to the owner, or if the owner cannot be identified,
then ASPCA will pay for the treatment. No cost will be incurred by the Fire Department or a
member for bringing in an injured animal encountered as part of a fire or EMS response.
The animal should be transported only to those clinics listed. They are equipped with full
emergency care facilities and have agreed to accept animals transported by the Fire Department
to their facilities.
It is very important to remember that an injured animal may present a danger to rescuers. At no
time should a member's safety be compromised in handling an injured animal. If an animal is
considered dangerous, the call should be referred to Maricopa County Animal Control.
OTHER AGENCIES
There are other agencies that can respond and deal with injured animals. They are listed under
"MDTINFO ANIMALS" in the CAD system. The first call, however, should be either the Humane
Society or ASPCA since they have personnel available 24 hours. If they are not able to handle
the problem, they will refer you to the appropriate agency.

RESPONSIBILITY
The determination of fire origin and cause is necessary for all fire incidents. The Officer in
Charge is responsible for determining when a Fire Investigator is needed. This determination is
dependent on the information gathered at the scene and/or circumstances of the fire. The onduty Fire Investigators are available through Dispatch and Deployment or by phone to consult
with Command prior to or during response to assist Command.
A fire investigation is conducted after fire control and salvage activities are completed, but
before overhaul actions, which could hinder the investigation.
DISPATCH
A Fire Investigator dispatched by Dispatch and Deployment or called by the Officer in Charge,
will respond to the scene reference the following circumstances:
•

Fire deaths or serious fire injuries

•

All working first alarm or greater structure fires

•

Fires for which the cause cannot be determined by Command on the scene

•

Explosions and bombings

•

Requested by Phoenix Police Department to respond to known arson fires

•

Car, field, or dumpster fires that have an identified lead or suspect in custody

•

Attempted arsons

NON-DISPATCH
A Fire Investigator is not needed for the following situations. The company officer is responsible
for completing an accurate Field Incident Report to document the fire cause:
•

Minor fires where cause is determined to be accidental

•

Scalding burns, electrical accidents, and minor accidental burn injuries

•

Car fires originating in the engine area during vehicle operation, abandoned autos, or
vehicle arsons with no identified suspects

•

Minor grass, fence, or trash fires with no witnesses or suspects

•

Traffic accident fatalities involving fire subsequent to collision (investigated by Phoenix
Police Department)

•

To hold the scene until another agency or service responds

•

When requested to make contact with homeowner for the purpose of insurance matters

•

Minor fires caused by juveniles playing with fire, matches, etc. These incidents are
referred to the Youth Firesetter Program. Referrals are made by completing the Youth

information gathered at the scene and/or circumstances of the fire, units on the scene shall
gather the information needed and to accurately complete the required report. If a victim
requests information regarding their fire loss, the Company Officer can give the Fire Department
Incident Number to assist the victim to accessing Fire Department information through the
Custodian of Records at 602-256-3395. The victim should also be given a copy of the P.F.D.
"After the Fire" brochure to assist them.
FIRE SCENE COORDINATION
When a Fire Investigator is on the scene or responding, companies will delay non-essential
overhaul and secure the fire scene until the Fire Investigator arrives. Salvage and all
unnecessary interim activities which may alter, contaminate the fire scene, or interfere with a
subsequent origin and cause investigation must be discontinued until authorized to continue by
the responding Fire Investigator.
Command will assign personnel to protect and maintain custody of the fire scene until the arrival
of a Fire Investigator, especially when a delay in response has been indicated by the
responding Fire Investigator.
After achieving fire control, Command may release companies not required for the completion of
the investigation and/or overhaul. In some cases, involving lengthy investigations, companies
may return to quarters and later respond back to the scene to complete overhaul activities when
requested by the Fire Investigations Sector.
Command will turn over jurisdiction of the fire area to the Fire Investigator as soon as possible
after the fire is stabilized. The Investigator retains jurisdiction of the scene until it is released
back to Command. The Fire Investigator may inform Command they need to maintain custody
of the scene for further investigation.
The Investigator will request from Command any personnel or equipment necessary for the
investigation. Command will make every attempt to meet such requests, to the extent possible
under the prevailing circumstances.
All personnel will cooperate with the Fire Investigator and the Fire Investigations Sector.
Protection of the fire scene and preservation of physical evidence is a primary concern once life
safety and fire control are achieved.
An attempt to identify the victims and witnesses at the fire scene will be made as soon as
possible, and will not be delayed until the Fire Investigator is on the scene. Obtaining the
identification of victims and witnesses is critical to the investigative process.

PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE
Every fire scene contains evidence. Fire fighting operations present the greatest potential for
damage to evidence which may be used by the Fire Investigators and the Police Department in
subsequent court cases and prosecution.
Evidence of fire cause is rarely destroyed by fire. The form, shape, color, size, and weight of
items may be altered, but evidence can still be identified upon trained examination. It is
imperative to preserve evidence as found, in place and not moving fire debris unnecessarily.
It is the responsibility of the Fire Department to protect the fire scene from unnecessary damage
during fire fighting operations. Special care exercised during extinguishment will avoid the
destruction of evidence through the misuse of fire streams. Salvage operations should be
minimal until the initial fire investigation is completed, and should be confined to diminishing
loss. Companies assigned to Loss Control Sector should incorporate scene security and
evidence preservation into their plan to stop the loss.
The fire scene is the Fire Investigator's laboratory. It is searched carefully and thoroughly,
photographed, diagrammed for placement of contents and evidence, and evidence is then
collected and preserved.
The fire scene must be secured. Evidence cannot be used in court unless the Fire Investigator
can establish a chain of custody by proving who found the evidence, where it was found and the
evidence was not tampered with while in official custody. To ensure that the chain of custody
remains unbroken, the scene must remain in the sole custody of the Fire Department. When at
a fire scene where custody must be maintained, a guard must be posted, and custody must be
maintained until the scene is released. No unauthorized persons may enter the scene. The Fire
Department has the legal authority to close the scene entirely, even to the property owner or to
other interested person/s. It is vital that the Fire Department prevent personnel from
unnecessarily walking through a fire area, walking on, obscuring evidence, or picking up and
moving evidence. This includes both Fire Department personnel and the media. If it is essential
that evidence be moved or if necessary fire fighting operations may damage evidence, the
evidence must be covered or its location marked before moving it carefully to a secure location.
ACCELERANT DETECTION CANINE
The Phoenix Fire Department Investigations Section has the services of an accelerant detection
canine assigned to the unit. The canine is used by the assigned Fire Investigator/Handler to
identify the use of accelerants in the ignition of the fire. Personnel should avoid contact with the
dog unless given permission by the dog handler.
The canine will be called by the on-duty Fire Investigator, as needed.

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish standard guidelines for conducting structural training fires
while complying with NFPA Standard 1403. All other Phoenix Regional procedures will also apply to
training fires where applicable.
The objective of a training fire is to provide realistic fire ground training under actual fire conditions for
recruit and uniformed firefighters while providing high levels of safety and minimizing risk to firefighters.
Training fires will be designed to minimize the risk and to control the fire conditions so that firefighters
are not unnecessarily exposed to hazards or injuries.
Training fires present the same hazards as those encountered at actual field incidents. The Incident
Command System employed at actual fire incidents will be Standard Operating Procedure at all
structural training fires. Refer to Volume II, Standard Operating Procedures.
PROCEDURES FOR ON OR OFF SITE BURNING
PERMITS
The Training Academy holds a burn permit issued by Maricopa County Environmental Services
Department. The officer in charge is responsible for complying with the conditions stated on the burn
permit. This includes burning only during the months and hours specified on the permit. Check the
burn permit located in the main office to verify that the permit is current and has not expired.
The officer in charge is also responsible for calling the Air Quality Division each morning of the day of
burning to obtain permission to burn that day. The phone number is (602) 506-6700. You must fill in
the log at the time of the phone call with your name, the person you spoke to, type of burn, and time of
day.
Note: Burns conducted outside the City of Phoenix boundaries may require local permits in addition to
the county permit. Check with local jurisdiction before burning.
All burns, (off-site and on-site) must be conducted in compliance with the Fire Department’s Burn
Permit issued by the Maricopa County Department of Environmental Services, Air Quality Division.
This includes limitations on the times when burns are allowed and pre-approval of all burns to ensure
that they do not contribute to violations of the air quality health standards. Burn permits conducted off
the training academy campus MAY require a burn permit specific to site/property where the burn is to
occur.
All structural off-site burns require an asbestos survey and filing a completed NESHAPs form with
Maricopa County Department of Environmental Services, Air Quality Division at least ten (10) working
days prior to the scheduled burn.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Page 2 of 11

COMMAND
One officer on the scene shall be designated as "Command" and will assume the Command functions.
A Command Post shall be established and positioned to afford maximum visibility of the structure,
operating companies and fire conditions.
COMMUNICATIONS
Command is responsible for establishing radio communications with each company officer or training
officer involved in the drill. Channel assignment must be coordinated with Dispatch and Deployment
and all companies involved. Companies operating at the training fire will continuously monitor the
assigned radio channel. All radios will be checked for proper functioning and correct channel prior to
initiating training fire operations.
SECTORS
To eliminate confusion, and provide adequate scene control, all personnel operating within the
fireground perimeter shall operate under the direction of a sector officer. The fireground perimeter shall
be defined as the hazardous area surrounding the burn structure and shall be determined by Command
following guidelines stated in Fireground Safety.
The following sectors shall be established on all structural training fires.
Interior -

Company or training officer directing interior suppression activities.

Exposure -

Provide manned, charged hose line positioned to protect exposed property. More than
one hose line (and therefore, more than one sector) may be required, depending on the
exposures present.

Rescue (RIC)

Provide a manned, charged back-up line for each fire attack team, in position to
assist in fire extinguishment and rescue of interior personnel. This sector will be
manned by experienced firefighting personnel (not recruit firefighters) and each Rapid
Intervention Crew (RIC) shall consist of a minimum of three firefighters. A company
officer shall be in charge of each RIC unit. There shall be one rescue (RIC) team for
each fire attack team. The RIC will be positioned in a ready state near the exterior point
of entry.

Rehab -

All personnel not assigned to other sectors will be under the direction of Rehab. Rehab
area will be established in a location that reduces congestion around the fire building.

Safety -

The Safety Officer (or a safety representative) will be in attendance at all structural
training fires and will assume safety sector responsibilities. The safety sector will
monitor personnel and fire conditions, and work with Command to ensure all safety
procedures are complied with, and that risk to personnel is minimized.

PRE-PLANNING
The officer in charge of the drill will conduct an initial inspection of the training fire site. If the building
appears acceptable, he/she will make an appointment with the Safety Officer to inspect the building.
Single-story structures shall always be considered first choice when selecting training in interior
firefighting operations. Two-story structures will only be considered when the building has been
thoroughly inspected by the Safety Officer and the Command officer. Both officers must agree that the
building is structurally sound for training burns. Adequate egress/access points on the second floor
must be readily available.
The officer coordinating the training fire will inspect the building with the Safety Officer. The building
must meet fire safety and structural integrity criteria before approval to conduct a training fire is given
by the Safety Officer. The Safety Officer shall have full authority to deny approval if the building is
determined unsafe. Buildings incapable of withstanding exposure to fire conditions shall not be utilized.

Traffic control will also be a major factor for consideration in approving live structural training fires.
Approval will not be given where traffic cannot be effectively controlled or re-routed.
ASBESTOS CONSIDERATIONS
Prior to scheduling any training activities an asbestos consideration must be conducted by an AHERA
accredited asbestos building inspector to ensure that no asbestos is present in the structure. The
asbestos survey must follow AHERA guidelines and in addition include sampling of all materials, which
are determined by the inspector to be suspect for asbestos. This MAY include roofing components,
ceiling tiles and finishes, flooring or interior and exterior textured wall treatment layers including but not
limited to stucco and paint. Metals, wood and glass are recognized as having no potential for asbestos.

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish standard guidelines for conducting on-site training
fires in the Training Academy burn building, while complying with NFPA Standard 1403. All other
Phoenix Fire procedures will apply to training fires where applicable.
GENERAL USAGE
Any fire department member or outside agency wishing to use the burn building must first obtain
permission from a Training Academy chief officer.
The time and date of the training drill must be scheduled with the Training Academy staff. Drills
involving recruit training and departmental training always have first priority.
An officer representing the Training Academy staff must be on-site for any live fire drills involving

PURPOSE
This plan is intended to serve as an operational guide when serious dry vegetation fires are
encountered. All Phoenix Regional standard operating procedures are in effect for WILDLAND fire
fighting except as amended or superseded by this plan.
OVERVIEW
The desert areas near Phoenix and surrounding communities occasionally see vegetation fires that
grow in complexity and resource needs. Oftentimes, these fires burn across jurisdictional boundaries
with state, tribal and federal lands. These fires typically are responded to by agencies from the Phoenix
Regional Dispatch System and create a low frequency, high risk incident for our personnel. Firefighter
safety is the primary objective for brush/wildland fire incidents.
Several jurisdictions of the Phoenix metropolitan area experience these types of incidents more so
than others. With this in mind, agencies with brush/wildland areas may have additional training,
capabilities and guidelines specific to their agency. Some agencies may constant staff water tenders
and brush trucks during brush fire season as conditions dictate.
Brush/wildland fires that occur on state, tribal or federal lands may have resources respond for
suppression and command needs. The agencies include the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire
Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, and
resources include engines, hand crews, aircraft and supervisory personnel. In some cases, these
agencies may prefer to form Unified Command with initial Phoenix Regional Dispatch units or relieve
the command when the fire is exclusively on state, tribal or federal jurisdiction.
DEFINITIONS
1. Air Attack - Aerial reconnaissance aircraft which can provide information from above the fire by
an observer.
2. Air Tanker -Fixed wing aircraft certified by the FAA as being capable of transport and delivery
of fire retardant solutions.
3. VLAT – Very Large Air Tanker – Fixed wing heavy Air Tanker DC10, 737, and larger in some
cases.
4. Buoy Wall Tank (Pumpkin)- Large 1500 to 4000-gallon collapsible water tank carried on some
water tenders used for a remote water source or fill station for Bambi Bucket operations. These
are not to be confused with a Fol-Da-Tank not designed for Bambi Bucket operations.
5. Bambi Bucket – Small 65 to 95-gallon bucket, externally attached to helicopters for water drops
on brush fires.
6. Division - Similar to a “sector”. A geographic work assignment (example East Division, or
Division A)
7. Group - Similar to a “sector”. A functional work assignment (example Water Supply Group)
8. LCES - Lookouts, Communications, Escape Routes, Safety Zones. A basic safety measure that
must be in place at all times for firefighter safety.
9. Red Flag Warning - A weather announcement made by the National Weather Service when fire
danger is Very High or Extreme. Sustained winds >= 20 mph and relative humidity <= 20%,

scattered thunderstorms, increased thunderstorm activity after a prolonged dry period, abrupt
change in wind speed and direction that may affect the area.
10. SEAT - Single Engine Air Tanker (similar to a crop duster) A fixed wing aircraft capable of
transport and delivery of fire retardant solutions of about 800 gallons.
11. Type 1 Engine - A typical structure engine. Crew of 4 personnel, minimum 400-gallon tank and
1000 gpm pump.
12. Type 3 Engine - Typically a short wheelbase engine capable of both structure and wildland fire
operations. Commonly 4-wheel drive, 500-gallon tank, 250 gpm pump.
13. Type 6 Engine - Approx. 200-gallon tank and 50 gpm pump with higher pump pressure capacity
than an engine and pump-and-roll capability. Typically, 4-wheel drive for off-road fire
suppression.
14. Water Tender (“Tender”) - A water transport and delivery fire apparatus. Capable of carrying
1000 to 5000 gallons of water. Pumps may range from 50 to 1500 gpm.
15. Tactical Tender – Has pump and firefighting capabilities.
16. Support Tender – Delivery of water only.
17. Wildland Fire - Any non-structure fire that occurs in the wildland.

POLICY
Resources responding to a brush/wildland fire will be familiar with National Incident Management
System (NIMS) terminology and practices. Resources should be prepared to work in
Sector/Division/Group assignments or other positions with resources from outside the regional dispatch
system.
Wildland fires typically demand a significant command and support staff to manage and will often
require resources from other Fire Departments and Government agencies. Command will be
responsible for requesting all needed resources.
Any WORKING FIRST ALARM BRUSH assignment or greater will be deemed a wildland fire and
receive appropriate additional resources. Dispatch will activate the "All Call," announce a wildland fire,
and provide the incident address. Dispatch will contact the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire
Management to inform them of the location/jurisdiction of the incident, the ID and location of the incident
commander, and fire spread potential.
Staff Officers will respond to multiple alarm wildland and brush fires as they do other multiple alarm
incidents and report to their pre-assigned responsibilities or staging. Command will assign this staff
support as needed.
The following resources will be dispatched for a brush/wildland incident:
STILL BRUSH
• Engine
• Brush

FIRE FIGHTER SAFETY
PPE
In the brush/wildland fire setting, proper personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential to fire fighter
safety. Structural turnout coats, pants and boots are not designed for brush/wildland fire suppression.

Page 4 of 10

Wildland PPE is designed to be more comfortable and functional while reducing fire fighter fatigue and
heat-related injuries.
A proper brush/wildland fire protective ensemble will consist of a helmet, fire resistive brush shirt/jacket,
fire resistive brush pants, eye and hearing protection, work gloves and leather ankle high boots. Nylon
hiking boots are inappropriate because of the melting and sticking potential of nylon.
Some regional agencies may have additional protective equipment guidelines that exceed these
minimum standards.
Hydration
Remember that heat is a major safety problem and all personnel should be kept well hydrated.
Personnel should have access to drinking water and carry canteens or similar water containers. Sterile
water bottles can be cleaned, filled with drinking water, and carried in the brush jacket pockets.
Wildland fire fighting is a physically demanding operation and members should be fit and prepared
mentally for a very hot, fast moving, and dangerous environment.
Crew Safety
Wildland fires demand that Company Officers maintain a high level of awareness regarding crew
accountability. Crew members can easily become spread out and not visible in rugged and rocky
terrain. Company Officers must maintain LCES (Lookouts, Communication, Escape Routes, and
Safety Zones) and control over crew members to ensure a safe operation. Wildland fire fighting will still
employ the buddy system. Watch out for each other.
ANY DEPARTMENT UTILIZING DRONES DURING A BRUSH/WILDLAND FIRE INCIDENT WILL
IMMEDIATELY LAND THE DRONE AS SOON AS ANY AIRCRAFT HAS BEEN ORDERED. THIS
WILL ENSURE THE SAFETY OF INCOMING AIRCRAFT AND EXPEDITE THE USE OF AIRCRAFT
FOR FIREFIGHTING OPERATIONS. REMEMBER: NO AIRCRAFT CAN FLY ON A FIRE IF A
DRONE IS UP.
Ten Standard Fire Orders
Wildland fires are fast moving and extremely dangerous. These scenes require that all personnel
understand these basic wildland fire fighting orders:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.

Keep informed on fire weather conditions and forecasts.
Know what the fire is doing at all times.
Base all actions on current and expected behavior of the fire.
Identify escape routes and safety zones and make them known.
Post lookouts when there is possible danger.
Be alert. Keep calm. Act decisively.
Maintain prompt communications with your forces, supervisor, and adjoining forces.
Give clear instructions and insure they are understood.

9. Maintain control of your forces at all times.
10. Fight fire aggressively, having provided for safety first.

Eighteen Watch Out Situations
Several situations have been found to increase the chance of injuries or fatalities on brush/wildland
fires. These include:
1. Fire not scouted or sized-up.
2. In country not seen in daylight.
3. Safety zones and escape routes not identified.
4. Unfamiliar with weather and local factors influencing fire behavior.
5. Uninformed on strategy, tactics and hazards.
6. Instructions and assignments not clear.
7. No communications link with crewmembers/supervisor.
8. Constructing line without a safe anchor point.

10. Attempting a frontal assault on the fire.
11. Unburned fuel between you and the fire.
12. Cannot see the main fire or not in contact with anyone who can.
13. You are on a hillside where rolling material can ignite fuel below.
14. Weather is getting hotter and drier.
15. Wind increases and/or changes direction.
16. Getting frequent spot fires across the line.
17. Terrain and fuels make escape to safety zones difficult.
18. Taking a nap near the fire line.
FIRE BEHAVIOR
The following factors have a critical effect on the fire behavior of a wildland fire. Command must
maintain an awareness of these conditions and be prepared to react quickly, pessimistically and well
ahead of the fire. The factors are: WEATHER, FUEL, and TOPOGRAPHY.
Weather
Command must be aware of constantly changing weather conditions. During a normal day, local winds
will change 180 degrees near midday and usually become gusty during the afternoon. Morning winds
are normally East to West and afternoon winds are usually West to East. Fire spread will usually
slowdown in the evening AS HUMIDITY INCREASES (25%) and increase during the midmorning hours
AS THE HUMIDITY DECREASES (15%).
A Red Flag Warning issued by the National Weather Service indicates when conditions are present
that may have substantial effects on any brush/wildland fire incidents during that period. Crews should
give special consideration to any fire incident under these conditions.
Command should always be aware of the fire conditions, weather conditions and time of day.
Remember that a large WILDLAND fire can create dangerous convection currents that cause erratic

fire behavior and spot fires far in advance of the fire head. Heavy winds also produce similar results.
Hot and dry conditions produce extremely rapid-fire spread. A slight decrease in relative humidity will
cause a significant increase in fire intensity. During extreme days surface-wetted fuel will dry in a few
minutes.
Fuel
Most of the fuel in the Phoenix area is relatively light and burns very rapidly. Fires will be mostly wind
driven and depending on fuel loading could require extensive overhaul. Fuels in the river bottoms are
usually a mix of grass, brush, and trees which will increase fire behavior and the time it takes to
extinguish them.
Topography
Fire burns uphill much more rapidly than downhill. On an uphill slope, the fire will tend to crown over
the top and start spot fires a considerable distance down the receding slope. A large free-burning fire
will tend to create its own convection currents and spot fires may be started. Access is often the most
serious problem with topography.
Companies with considerable brush fire potential should size-up areas with regard to fuel, topography
and extent of exposure to structures. Particular attention should be paid to access roads and
accessible areas where apparatus may travel. Natural fire breaks and potential exposure problems
should be noted on the area maps provided for this purpose.
COMMAND
The first arriving company officer who assumes Command must address the values at risk. This
includes life safety, structures threatened, fire control, and property conservation benchmarks. In a
wildland fire setting the life safety benchmarks must include fire fighters as well as civilians. Command
must have a plan that includes LCES (Lookouts, Communications, Escape Routes and Safety Zones)
for fire fighters and equipment. LCES should be in place prior to any fire suppression operations.
Individual sectors can establish escape routes and safety zones depending on need or location.
Escape routes and safety zones should be easily accessible and large enough to prevent radiant heat
injuries or direct flame impingement. Aerial operations should not be located near safety zones.

On major incidents, establish a Command Post and sectors/divisions/groups as soon as possible. The
Command Post should be in a location which will be safe and not have to move if the fire changes
direction. Supporting elements should be able to set up at the Command Post. Select a site where a
helicopter may land in close proximity to the Command Post.
The Command Post will need to plot progress, exposures and access. The units in the field, particularly
geographic sectors/divisions/groups, will have to report this information back to Command via radio or
personal contact.
As fire spread becomes critical, Command must be prepared to special call additional attack units by
specific companies or to request assistance by standardized alarm responses. This determination
must be made early.
When brush/wildland fires begin to threaten homes, Command must be prepared to readjust and
develop a defensive strategy to protect exposures while allowing the fire to burn to a location better
suited for control.
TACTICS AND STRATEGY
Brush fires often present a large area of rapidly spreading fire. The critical decision is often where to
attack the fire to the best advantage. Protection of exposures is the primary goal when immediate
control is not possible.
Size Up
A deliberate and thorough initial size up is extremely important on significant or potentially significant
fire incidents in order to develop a fire fighting plan. The initial incident commander should take the
necessary time to gather pertinent information on the fires location, spread rates and direction,
identified hazards, any threats to improvements (structures, power lines, etc) and anticipated needed
resources. The following is a list of size-up considerations that greatly affect tactics and strategy:
Fire:
•
•
•
•
•

Location of fire head or heads
Size of fire and rate of speed
Flame length
Spot fires
Accessibility into fire area

Fuel:
•
•
•

Fuel continuity
Type of fuel—grass, brush, trees
Fuel loading - light, heavy

Temperature
Wind speed and direction
Relative Humidity

Topography:
• Is it flat ground or on hillside
• Bottom, middle or top of hill
Hazards:
• Exposures--improvements, buildings, crops, etc.
• Special hazards (e.g., spot fires, hazardous materials, etc.)
Resources
• Manpower needs
• Water resource (e.g., tenders, hydrants, etc.)
Command must then quickly develop an incident action plan based on this size up.
Direct Attack (Offensive)
Direct attack should be used whenever fire conditions allow fire personnel to work directly and safely
on the fires edge. Personnel should “anchor and flank” a fire by first establishing a safe location, or
anchor point, to start the attack without being outflanked by fire. An example of an anchor point would
be a road or green farm field.
Fire suppression personnel on fires in light fuels should use the “one foot in the black” method in an
inside out attack where the safety zone is the previously burned area adjacent to the burning fire front.
Unlike a structural fire attack, a brush/wildland fire attack should be from the BURNED (black) side
where possible. Structural fire fighters can find themselves entrapped by fire when attacking a fire
head-on from the unburned side where fire can quickly overrun them.
A direct water attack is the fastest control evolution available to counteract wildfire spread. Brush trucks
can accomplish this through pump-and-roll tactics. Apparatus and personnel should be in the burned
(black) area as opposed to the unburned fuels.
Indirect Attack (Defensive)
Indirect attack methods are used when fire personnel are prohibited from direct attack due to fire
conditions or access to the fire. For indirect attack strategy, fire personnel work some distance away
from the fires edge. This may be in support of wildland fire crew burnout operations, structure protection
or another tactic.
On large open grass fires, Command must take advantage of natural fire barriers that will assist in
control measures, such as: dry sandy washes, roads, trails, rock outcroppings, patch fuels, etc.

Structure Protection/Interface Operations
During interface fires involving brush and structures it may be necessary to retain a 3-1 structural
assignment in staging and be prepared to assign those units to conduct structural firefighting if needed.
These staged resources will be turned out and equipped to carry out interior structural firefighting.
Units assigned to protect a structure or improvement should first thoroughly size up the site to ensure
firefighter safety can be maintained. The Company Officer should walk the driveway or access road to
ensure apparatus have good access and clearance and that the site is deemed safe to protect.
Apparatus should back-in to allow for quick egress is necessary.
During structure protection, crews should plan to remain as mobile as possible in case escape is
necessary. Hose lays should be as short as possible and limited to one or two at most. “Bump bags”
or other hose packs may be used by some regional departments that have more frequent or substantial
interface areas. These hose packs consist of 1 ½” “trunk” line with a gated “y” and one or two 1” forestry
hose lines with nozzle.
When water is in short supply, it is usually most effective when applied to burning material instead of
wetting fuel in advance. Seriously exposed structures should be kept wet, using appropriate foam if
possible.
Tactical challenges and hazards for structure protection:
(Firefighters with a safety zone can safely defend structures with some challenges)
• Narrow roads, unknown bridge limits, and septic tank locations
• Ornamental plants and combustible debris next to structure
• Wooden siding and/or wooden roof materials
• Open roof vents, eaves, decks, and other ember traps
• Fuel tanks and hazardous materials
• Power lines
• Limited water sources
• Property owners remaining onsite
MOP-UP
After direct or indirect line work is completed and a fire is called "Under Control," many things remain
to be done to make the fire line safe and put the fire out. This work is called mop up. The objective of
mop up is to put out all fire embers or sparks to prevent them from crossing the fire line.
A certain amount of mop up work is done along with line building. Mop up becomes an independent
part of firefighting as soon as the spread of the fire is stopped, and all line has been completed.
Ordinarily, mop up is composed of two actions; putting the fire out, and disposing of fuel either by
burning to eliminate it, or removing the fuel so it cannot burn. The principles of mop up follow:
1. Start work on each position of line just as soon as possible after line construction and burning
out are completed. Treat most threatening situations first.

2. Allow fuel to burn up if it will do so promptly and safely.
3. On small fires, all fire should be extinguished in the mop up, where quantities of burning material
are not so large as to make this impractical.
4. On large fires, completely mop up enough of the area adjacent to the line to be certain no fire
can blow, spot, or roll over the fire line under the worst possible conditions.
5. Search for smoldering spot fires.
6. All smoldering material that is not put out with water or dirt should be spread well inside of lines.
7. Eliminate or put into a safe area all less flammable fuels, such as rotten logs and snags, which
are outside, but near the control line.
8. Eliminate all burned trees inside of line that could throw sparks over line or fall over the line.
9. Put all rolling material in a position that it cannot possibly roll across the line.
10. Look for indications of hot spots. Some are gnats swarming, white ash, ground which shows
pin holes, and wood boring insects.
11. Use water wherever possible and practical in mop up.
12. Use water sparingly but use enough to do the job. Match the amount of water to the job.
13. Adding Class A foam to water will greatly increase effectiveness in mop up of deep-burning
fuels.

When addressing mop up operations, Command should:
1. Determine the distance inside the control line to be overhauled (for small fires, this may be the
entire burn area).
2. During rehab of mop up crews, ensure at least two fire fighters remain in the area to monitor
for re-ignition or spread of fire.
3. Schedule for follow-up checks by crews to ensure the fire is out in mopped up perimeter.

BRUSH/WILDLAND FIRE AIR SUPPORT
M.P. 202.15A

12/12-R

Page 1 of 3

Purpose
To ensure the safe and effective use of aerial firefighting resources on a wildland / brush fire within the
areas protected by Phoenix Regional Departments.
Overview
Aerial firefighting resources are an effective tool when dealing with a wildland / brush fire. Their
functions are imperative to fire suppression activities. Some of these functions include delivering water
or fire retardant to inaccessible areas; assist in completing fire line gaps and cooling the head or flanks
of a fast spreading fire. However, it must be noted that the use of aircraft dramatically increases the
hazard level of the fire ground and adds a greater responsibility on the incident commander. The
benefits must be weighed against the risks. The following guidelines should be in place when using
aerial resources.
Definitions
Air Attack: Air Attack is a fixed wing aircraft with a pilot and air attack group supervisor on board. The
air attack group supervisor responsibility is to coordinate with command, aircraft and ground forces
ensuring aircraft safety, correct drop locations as requested by ground forces and to act as aerial recon
for all ground forces.
Rotary wing: Rotary wing aircraft is a helicopter used on an incident for recon, crew shuttle and water
drops.
Fixed wing: Fixed wing aircraft include any airplane used on an incident for air resource coordination,
a.k.a. air attack, or retardant drops.
Types of fixed wing aircraft
S.E.A.T: Single engine air tanker holding 600 – 800 gallons of retardant.
Large Air Tanker: holds up to 3000 gals of retardant.
Very Large Air Tanker: A very large air tanker is a DC10 holding 10,000 gallons of retardant.
Lead plane: A lead plane is aircraft used as a guide for heavy and large air tankers to mark flight
routes and drop sites.
Landing zone: A landing zone is a large area, clear of obstructions, where rotary wing aircraft can
land.
Dip Site: A dip site is a large area clear of obstructions, with a 300’ approach and departure path clear
of structures and personnel with a water supply from a lake, pond or buoy wall that can be supplied by
a water tender or engine utilizing a hydrant.
(Note: on a wildland fire ground, large aircraft are referred to as tankers and water hauling
equipment is a tender.)
Requesting Aircraft
When it is determined that aerial resources are needed, contact Alarm and request the type of aircraft
desired. Alarm can dispatch local resources such as Phoenix PD, Mesa PD and DPS Ranger 41. Other
rotary wing aircraft and fixed wing aircraft must come through an interagency order from Arizona State
Forestry which will include State and Federal resources. When requesting these resources, ask for air
attack in addition to the suppression aircraft. When State or Federal resources arrive on scene, local air
resources must leave the incident per State and Federal guidelines.

Communications
All aircraft shall be on a secure radio channel with the position of air operations being the ground
contact located at the incident command post. All request for water / retardant drops must go through
command to Air Operations who will assign an aircraft for the drop. Air Operations will provide pilot the
location of the drop on the fire and the radio channel of the ground contact in order to ensure proper
drop location. After the drop, the aircraft will contact Air Operations on the Air Operations channel. The
dip site manager shall monitor the Air Operations channel.
Aircraft use and restrictions
Considering the hazards associated with low flying aircraft, the following shall be adhered to.
• Aircraft used for water / retardant drops shall not be used at night.
• Rotary wing aircraft carrying an external load, i.e. bambi buckets, shall not fly over occupied
structures. All structures should be considered occupied.
• All State and Federal resources must be on the ground 30 minutes prior to sunset. The Incident
commander must consider the tactical challenges this could cause when constructing the
incident action plan.
Dip Site / L.Z/Helispots location
Dip sites / Landing zones/Helispots should be set up within proximity to the incident; however, not close
enough to interfere with ground operations. The following should be considered:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Approach and departure routes must be clear 300’ in all directions
Terrain should be flat and paved if possible
Dust control procedures must be in place
Water supply location: is there a hydrant close by or is a water tender going to be utilized for a
shuttle operation or to supply a Buoy Wall.
Travel time to and from the fire line along with travel routes
Wind direction and a plan for potential wind shifts effecting approach and departure.

PROGRESS REPORTING TO COMMAND
Progress reports on the effectiveness of water drops on the fire from Sectors to Command are
essential. Sectors will advise Command of the need for water drops and provide specific locations.
Unless otherwise directed by Command, Sectors and crews do not communicate directly with the
helicopter pilot.

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish a standard deployment for wildland-urban interface fire
incidents.
DEFINITIONS
Wildland-urban interface is defined as the zone of transition between wildland (or unoccupied land) and
human development.
POLICY
A growing number of fire departments within the Central Arizona Life Safety Response Council
(CALSSRC) face the problem of protecting the wildland-urban interface. Fire Departments must
continue to focus on the unique fire protection challenges associated with the wildland-urban interface.
Through a systematic process of pre-incident planning, Company Officers are responsible for the
identification of areas within their first-due that are at risk for an urban-interface fire incident. These
areas should be reported to their Battalion Chief for identification in the CAD system. Once entered
into the CAD system, any reported brush fire incident will have an urban-interface assignment
deployed by the dispatch center.
The following resources will be dispatched for an urban-interface incident:
URBAN-INTERFACE ASSIGNMENT:
• 5 – Engines
• 1 – Ladder
• 3 – Brush Trucks
• 2 – Tenders
• 2 – Command Officers
• 1 – Rescue (or ambulance)
• 1 – Shift Commander
• 1 – CXX19

RED FLAG WARNINGS
M.P. 202.15C

04/20-N

Page 1 of 2

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to develop standard actions and considerations when a Red Flag
Warning is issued.
DEFINITIONS
A Red Flag Warning is issued by the National Weather Service for weather events which may result in
extreme fire behavior that will occur within 24 hours. A Red Flag Warning is the highest level of
weather-related fire warning. A Red Flag Warning will normally be issued for severe fire weather
events less than 12 hours in the future. The area affected, onset time, and a statement describing the
conditions will be included in the forecast. Thresholds for Red Flag Warnings vary based on vegetation
type, topography and other factors, but in the Phoenix area they are generally Sustained winds >= 20
mph and relative humidity <=20%, scattered thunderstorms, increased thunderstorm activity after a
prolonged dry period, abrupt change in wind speed and direction that may affect the area.
POLICY
When the Phoenix Fire Department Regional Dispatch Center (PFDRDC) receives notification of a Red
Flag Warning they should notify all on-duty units via an MCT message. If a Red Flag Warning extends
from one shift into the next shift, the MCT message should be repeated at 0800 immediately following
shift change to notify the new on-duty crews. The message from PFDRDC to on-duty crews should
include the standard Red Flag Warning details:
• Affected Area: This may include counties, cities or fire weather zones
• Wind: Speed and direction
• Timing: The hours the Red Flag Warning will be in effect
• Relative Humidity: Fine fuels found in the Phoenix area such as grass and bushes are
particularly susceptible to fire when humidity is low
• Other: Include any additional pertinent information provided by the National Weather Service
An all-call on channel one will also be made to all stations that there is a Red Flag Warning in effect.
This warning should be issued when the Red Flag Warning comes into the PFDRDC and repeated at
0830 for each shift the warning is in effect.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
Wildland Urban Interface: In Wildland Firefighting, a Red Flag Warning represents the highest
probability of a wildfire occurring. The warning also indicates a significant danger to firefighters when
operating on a wildfire incident. Red Flag conditions such as sustained winds >20mph, abrupt wind
speed and direction changes and low relative humidity combine to create a very dynamic and
dangerous incident. During a Red Flag Warning, Company Officers should ensure that each crew
establishes lookouts, communications, escape routes and safety zones (LCES) prior to exiting the
vehicle to begin operations. Weather and wind conditions should be communicated to all crew
members frequently. Any direct fire attack during a Red Flag Warning should occur from the burned
side of the fire. Command officers should be pessimistic in their evaluation of potential cut-offs and fire
breaks. Wildfires are extremely difficult to control during Red Flag conditions and have a high

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

RED FLAG WARNINGS
M.P. 202.15C

04/20-N

Page 2 of 2

probability of spreading. Outside aid from state, tribal and federal resources should be considered early
in the incident.
Structural Firefighting: A Red Flag Warning represents the same extreme danger during structural
firefighting incidents as the danger in the wildland. Wind driven fires have led to firefighter injuries and
fatalities across the United States. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST), wind speeds as little as 10 miles per hour can cause rapid fire progression in a structure
regardless of the structure type (houses, apartments, high-rise, etc.). When sizing-up the incident, all
members should pay particular attention to wind direction and attack the fire from the windward side
when possible. Opening any door on the leeward side of the fire will create a flow path and cause the
fire to grow. Disciplined door control will help to alleviate the potential for firefighters being caught in a
flow path. Transitional attacks from the windward side are very effective at cooling the interior prior to
entry. All crews should closely coordinate any ventilation including windows, doors or vertical
ventilation.

Review Date: 04/2028
PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to identify operational tactics and considerations for motor
vehicle fires. As sales of electric and hybrid vehicles increase, fire departments must continue to
modify our tactics to address evolving safety and tactical considerations.
OVERVIEW
There is no such thing as a standard vehicle fire. The innovation and design of motor vehicles
today has created many different hazards for firefighters. Early recognition of the involvement of
an Electric Vehicle (EV), Hybrid Vehicle (HV) Vehicle with Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), Compressed
Natural Gas (CNG) and emerging technologies such as Hydrogen powered vehicles. Autonomous
Driving vehicles represent special risks associated with this emerging technology. This
information is critical to size up and initial decision making on the incident. This information
should be gathered by AHQ if possible. Crews must complete a size-up and attempt to identify the
type of vehicle they are dealing with. Responding crews should rely on visual signs to include
vehicle markings, color of smoke, location of smoke and/or fire, and any other signs that signal a
crew to be aware of the products involved. Remember to consider the following important steps
for all vehicle fires:
1. Identify the vehicle type and address life safety.
2. Address scene safety, apparatus placement and tactical positioning, immobilize the vehicle,
when possible, chock wheels, etc.
3. Disable the vehicle, turnoff ignition, operate emergency shutoff if equipped, remove key or
fab, consider addressing the factory labeled cable cut points.
The minimum level of protection for firefighters is full protective clothing breathing air from their
SCBA. Captains must wear full protective clothing to directly supervise crews.
CAR FIRES
Page 1 of 6

APPARATUS PLACEMENT
Apparatus should be placed upwind and uphill of the incident if possible. This is to afford
protection from hazardous liquids and vapors and reduces smoke in the work area. Position the
apparatus to protect the scene from on-coming traffic, using the apparatus as a barrier, to shield
the incident scene from traffic hazards. Warning lights should be left operating, in conjunction
with the use of traffic cones where needed. The use of flares by fire and police should be used
with caution; consider the potential for flammable liquids and vapors. Additional consideration
should be given to positioning the apparatus at an angle to better allow the removal of any hose
from the preconnected cross-lay compartments.
WATER SUPPLY/EXTINGUISHMENT
Except in the case of a large fuel fire, water is the best for extinguishment of motor vehicle fires,
however if not immediately available dry chemicals, CO2, foam, or another typical extinguishing
agent should be considered. If an EV/HV has been identified and is on fire, large amounts of water
will be required to cool the batteries if the batteries catch fire, are exposed to high heat, or is
generating heat or gases. It can take 3,000 gallons or more of water applied to the battery to fully
extinguish AND cool down the batteries. This will require an uninterrupted water supply.
FIRE ATTACK
The minimum size of hose line to initiate an attack on a vehicle fire is the 1 ¾ inch handline.
Approach the vehicle with full PPE and SCBA with facepiece, initiate the fire attack from a 45degree angle, utilizing the reach of the fire stream to begin to extinguish the fire. First water should
be applied to extinguish or protect the passenger compartment and an all clear should be
obtained. Wheel chocks should be applied to prevent the vehicle from rolling. Hand tools can
assist in providing access into vehicle spaces.
GENERAL HAZARDS AND SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Energy absorbing bumpers consist of gas and fluid filled cylinders that when heated during
a fire, will develop high pressures which may result in the sudden release of the bumper
assembly. This could result in serious injury to anyone in its path. Bumper assemblies have
been known to travel 25 feet.
• Batteries have Explosion/Flammability/Toxicity and Electrical shock hazards. Avoid contact
with battery components.
• Trunk rear hatch, engine hoods, etc., have hold-open devices that may employ, along or in
any combination with any of the following: springs, gas cylinders, extending arms, etc.
When gas cylinders are exposed to heat, failure or rupture of these devices should be
expected. Excessive pressure may develop in lift assists causing a trunk, hatch, or hood to
fly open with explosive force when the latch mechanism is released. To ensure personal
safety, be sure to allow sufficient clearance when releasing latches.
• Fires involving the trunk/cargo area should be approached with extreme caution. Contents
may include toxic, flammable, or other hazardous materials. Expect the worst!
CAR FIRES

•

Fuel tanks may be constructed of sheet metal or plastic. A rupture or burn-through may
occur with these tanks causing a rapid flash fire of the fuel. Do not remove gas cap, as tank
may have become pressurized. Do not direct hose stream into tank, as this will cause
pressurization of tank, with a possible result of burning fuel spewing from the tank fill
opening.
Well-sealed interiors of modern vehicles present the potential for vent-limited fire on the
interior which may grow significantly when fresh air is introduced during suppression. Use
caution when opening doors or breaking windows. Appropriate approach, ventilation, and
safety concerns must be considered. Have a charged handline ready before making entry.
At least one member of the attack team must have forcible entry tools in his/her possession
to provide prompt, and safe entry into the vehicle.
Vehicle stability tires or split rims exposed to fire may explode, causing the vehicle to drop
suddenly. Expect exploding rim parts or tire debris to be expelled outward from the sides.
Approach from the front or rear of the vehicle for maximum protection from potential flying
debris. Some larger vehicles, such as buses, employ an air suspension system. When these
systems are exposed to heat or flame, they may fail, causing the vehicle to SUDDENLY
drop several inches.

Where patients are trapped in the vehicle, first water should be applied to protect the patients and
permit rescue. When rescue is not a factor, first water should be applied for several seconds to
extinguish fire or cool down the area around any fuel tanks or fuel systems. This is especially
important if the fuel tanks are LPG or CNG.
LPG & CNG
LPG and CNG are used as fuel for vehicles. Pressure release devices can create a lengthy "blow
torch" effect, or should the pressure relief device fail, a BLEVE may occur. Vehicles may not be
marked to identify this fuel hazard. If there is flame impingement on a visible LPG/CNG storage
tank, take action to control the fire and cool the tank. Operate emergency shutoff controls to stop
the flow of gas from the storage tank. If vapors escaping from the storage tank relief valve have
ignited, allow the LPG/CNG to burn while protecting exposures and cooling the tank. Flow of gas
through piping can be controlled by shutting off the valve at the storage tank. Balance to a 2 & 1
hazardous assignment.
ELECTRIC & HYBRID VEHICLES
When arriving on scene, the first step is proper size up. This includes the extent of the fire and if
it’s a compartment fire or includes the electrical components of the vehicle. Once life safety has
been addressed, fire companies should determine if they should suppress the fire or simply allow
the vehicle to burn. This can be based on exposures, the extent of the fire, etc. EVs can be viewed
as a battery energy storage system on wheels. Batteries are simply a method to store energy and
once the batteries have gone into thermal runaway, we understand that the vehicle is most likely

CAR FIRES

a total loss. Control efforts must consider life safety, property conservation, exposure protection,
environmental protection, and firefighter safety.
EV fires pose additional hazards to firefighters due to the battery systems. When the decision is
made to control the fire, the best method for controlling a battery fire is with water. Battery fires
will initially show from under the vehicle where the batteries are located.
1. Protect the working area and position apparatus, accordingly, wear full PPE with SCBA and
facepiece, ensure the EV is in park and off when possible.
2. Balance the assignment to a 3-1 Hazardous Materials assignment.
3. Secure a water supply.
4. Chock the wheels. EVs move silently, so never assume the power is off and never assume
the EV will not move.
5. Small fires that do not involve the high voltage batteries can be extinguished using typical
firefighting methods.
6. For well involved EVs, remember once the interior, contents, etc., are extinguished,
sustained suppression on the battery pack may be necessary. Use 1 3/4-inch hand lines to
suppress and cool fire and battery. Put water on burning surfaces. The use of AFFF is
contraindicated. The use of Class A foam reduces the cooling effect of water in this
application.
a. Attack an EV fire at a 45-degree angle initiating attack from 40 feet away and move
forward. Batteries may vent below the vehicle's rocker panels and exhaust out the
sides of vehicles.
7. Do not cut into or puncture the battery pack.
8. When necessary, efforts to protect dry-wells and storm drains through diversion and diking
should be used. Protect exposures and evacuate the area.
9. EV batteries shall always be considered energized.
10. Recognize off gassing as a sign of continued battery degradation. This visible vapor cloud
is toxic and flammable. It may appear as a white smoke even post extinguishment.
General Awareness & Safety Concerns
The high voltage battery system is controlled through the low voltage battery system. It is
important to disable both systems when possible. Locating and cutting the negative terminal on
the low voltage side is necessary to potentially disable the system. It is important to note that it
may take up to 10 minutes for some electrical capacitors to fully discharge. The batteries will
retain stranded energy and will continue to pose an electrical hazard.
Hybrid vehicles will have lithium batteries and another fuel source. You will have hazards of high
voltage battery systems and the other fuel. If during fire attack with water, the fire does not go
out. Consider the use of dry chemical extinguishers for initial suppression.

CAR FIRES
Page 4 of 6

If vehicle is extinguished check temperatures of battery locations with TIC or temp gun, it is
important to understand that you are looking at the casing around the battery with your tool. It is
more critical to document trending temperatures to indicate if heat is building or if the heat is
decreasing. Reignition potential is indicated by temps increasing. An increase in temperature will
indicate the potential for a secondary fire. If the batteries have suffered thermal or mechanical
insult the potential for electrocution is present, limit contact to the vehicle. Electric vehicles
involved in fire should have a stable or reducing temperature for at least one hour before turning
the car over to a tow company. Reignition may occur.
The use of a thermal blanket may be considered to create a fire stop and isolate the burning
vehicle’s ability to extend. The thermal blanket does not stop the thermal runaway process.
Without a life hazard or an exposure, the IAP may allow us to let the vehicle burn or just battery
pack burn and treat the vehicle shell as an exposure. This may limit the total amount of smoke
produced.
Hazard mitigation on EV fires is a collaborative process. The NFPA actively maintains a collection
of Emergency Response Guides from vehicle manufactures. To access these documents, use the
link below:
NFPA - Emergency Response Guides for Alternative Fuel Vehicles
Post EV/HV Incident Considerations
The general guidance provided to towing companies and storage facilities is to provide a 50-foot
clear space around the EV once stored and never inside a building.
Consider briefing towing companies on this and escorting them to the vehicle storage location.
Remember, thermal events with the battery system can continue for some time after the initial
incident.
FIRES INVOLVING ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS
Fires involving EV charging stations should be treated as a fire involving any other electrical
equipment:
• Secure Power to the EV Chargers.
• Once power is secured, the fire can be extinguished.
VEHICLES IN PARKING GARAGE
Any vehicle fire in a parking garage poses unique challenges. Upgrade the assignment to a 3 & 1.
This will provide additional resources. A thorough size-up of incident factors must be performed.
Some example considerations are:
• What level is the vehicle on?
CAR FIRES
Page 5 of 6

•
•
•
•
•

Is this an above ground or below grade?
What exposures are attached to the garage?
Is there a life hazard in the exposed areas?
Where is the smoke traveling?
Although non-combustible, the concrete structure can be weakened by extended exposure
to the heat of a fire.

Supporting the sprinkler system is a high priority to limit fire spread. Many modern midrise
buildings have a combination system that supports the sprinklers and the standpipe from one
system. These buildings often have no fire pump, and the system is charged with municipal
pressure. Pumping the FDC increases the GPM flow and pressure for both the sprinklers and the
attack line.
When the incident has concluded, we should not be leaving the incident with building fire
protection systems inoperable, rendering the building unprotected (please see M.P. 202.19 and
202.19A and/or your departments specific policies and adopted fire code regulations).
Controlling the ventilation system will aid in the protection of occupants of the parking garage and
the exposures. A size up of the smoke travel/spread must be performed. If the garage is attached
to an occupied structure, command must evaluate smoke spread and evacuate occupants from
the affected areas. This will limit the exposure to toxic smoke.
Ladder companies may be used as an improvised standpipe at incidents on elevated freeways or
parking garages.

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines for the response of Fire Department personnel
and equipment to aircraft emergency situations. The procedure outlines responsibilities for an onairport and off-airport Fire personnel. It identifies and defines the alarm terminology, airport alert
response, airport staging areas, Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) standby locations, general
aircraft fire fighting information, and the communication requirements.
GENERAL AVIATION FIRE FIGHTING RESPONSE PLAN
Since an aircraft crash can occur anywhere in the metropolitan area, off-airport units need to be
informed of some basic tactical information and guidelines when dealing with aircraft crash incidents.
There are two types of aircraft crashes:
1. High Impact
2. Low Impact
TACTICAL BENCHMARKS
Below listed are tactical benchmarks to consider for any type of aircraft accident.
1. The first arriving unit should assume command and determine if the flight crew has initiated
emergency evacuation procedures. Fire Department personnel should make every effort to prevent
an unnecessary evacuation by immediately contacting the flight crew and reporting exterior
conditions to them.
2. If emergency evacuation is in progress, assist evacuation of passengers and/or provide them a path
of egress, by discharging Class B foam only, from apparatus. Create a path through the burning
flammable liquid from the escape exit door to a safe area. If Class B foam is not available, use
large volumes of water. Protect the aircraft fuselage from direct flame impingement since fire can
burn through fuselage within 60 seconds. Ensure your own supply line. Master stream appliances
(Stang Guns) utilizing fog patterns; provide quick water in large volumes to protect passengers
during evacuation.
3. Deploy an attack line to the aircraft’s interior, without inhibiting passenger egress. Fire intensity will
require the use of 1-3/4" or 2" hand-lines, utilizing fog patterns.
4. Provide interior ventilation as soon as possible inside the aircraft. Fatalities in survivable aircraft
crashes are usually due to smoke inhalation. Use wide angle fog patterns from hand-lines to
ventilate. Positive Pressure Ventilation (PPV) is beneficial, however may not be initially expedient.
Pressurize from unburned area and provide ventilation exit in fire area. Ventilation should be started
at the same time as the attack lines are put into operation, if possible.
5. Aircraft have common attic spaces, large open cargo areas (in belly), and sidewalls that can have
running fires in these confined spaces. Consider using penetrating nozzles to reach fire in confined
spaces or any location where interior attack lines cannot be deployed.

6. Use ladders at the aircraft at the wing or other accessible points. Some aircraft may require aerial
ladders to reach access points.
7. Obtain primary and secondary all clears. Never assume absence of survivors.
8. Provide for interior lighting.
9. Request Police Department secures the scene and provides a holding area to assist in the control
of the ambulatory passengers.
10. Establish both fire and medical sectors as soon as possible. Designate sectors for both sides of the
aircraft to protect the escape routes and manage the evacuated passengers. Assign sectors to
address scene lighting, extrication, treatment, transportation and site safety.
11. Consider establishing a branch level command system to address Fire and Medical Operations
separately.
12. Ensure necessary amounts of foam extinguishing agents to amounts of flammable liquids on fire.
13. Maintain effective foam blanket to prevent ignition / re-ignition of fuel.
14. Maintain awareness of electricity generated by large aircraft, aircraft generate sufficient electrical
and hydraulic energy to seriously injure personnel and/or ignite fuel sources.
15. Jagged metal from aircraft can cut through protective clothing and hose lines.
16. To gain access into the fuselage, use the wing area or a platform ladder truck to work from. The
optimum place to cut is around windows and roof area. Hydraulic powered tools (Hurst, Holmatro,
etc.) and pry bars do not work well on aircraft metals due to the lack of solid supports to work
against.
17. If saws are used for extrication or ventilation, arcing and sparking will need to be suppressed with
water/foam from hand lines. Maintain integrity of foam blanket on flammable liquids. Be aware that
aircraft have numerous high pressure hydraulic lines that operate at 3000 psi; these can cause
serious injury if cut or broken under pressure.
18. Ensure back-up crew/s with charged hose lines in place to protect all personnel who will be working
inside the spilled flammable liquid areas. All personnel working in these areas shall be fully turned
out with protective gear and S.C.B.A. face piece on.
19. Have police secure a route of ingress / egress, to permit emergency equipment, particularly
ambulances, unimpeded movement to / from the incident.
20. Do not allow any overhaul operations to take place until all investigative agencies are finished or
unless needed to rescue victims or suppress fire.

PHOENIX REGIONAL

21. Large aircraft have oxygen cylinders on board that can explode, become missiles, and/or accelerate
the spread of fire.
22. Adopt a defensive mode of operation, as needed, to protect personnel and exposures.
23. Request the Alarm Room notify the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Notification can
be made contacting the FAA Air Traffic Control Tower at Sky Harbor Airport or by calling Sky
Harbor Communications at 273-3311.
24. Request the Alarm Room notify area hospitals, Salvation Army, Red Cross, County Emergency
Disaster Coordinator, C.I.D. Team and Sky Harbor Communication Center.
25. For off airport responses consider requesting ARFF foam trucks, Medical Support 19 or Foam 34
or 54, if they have not been dispatched. Off airport ARFF response from Sky Harbor has a 5 mile
radius. Any other request for Sky Harbor Foam Trucks for off-airport response should be
coordinated through BC19 or District 19 Chief. The airport must maintain an index of 3 foam trucks
at all times.
26. Have an airline representative report to the Command Post along with the District 19 Chief, liaison
from the Aviation Department, and any other agency that can assist with the incident.

Operational Information
High piled outside combustible storage incidents can be as dangerous to firefighters as
structural fire incidents. Each incident has its own unique challenges for our service delivery as
well as managing firefighter safety. It is imperative that our incident command system utilize
the same strategic decision‐making model for high piled outside combustible storage incidents
as it does for structural fire incidents.
The standard decision‐making model includes:
1. The identification of the incident’s critical fireground factors
2. Selection of the appropriate risk management plan
3. Identification of strategy
4. Development of an Incident Action Plan (IAP)
5. Identification and completion of the incidents tactical objectives.
This process is ongoing and continual, which requires a review/revision based on actions and
conditions until the tactical objectives are met.
1. Critical Factors
Identifying the critical factors while responding to and arriving on any incident scene is
imperative to a successful outcome. The size up for high piled outside combustible storage
incidents should include:










Incident location
Type and amount of material burning
Fire growth potential
Exposures
Water supply (hydrants, drafting, tankers)
Fire apparatus access
Hazards (hazardous materials storage tanks, power lines, underground gas, railroad
tracks, rail cars, etc)
Environmental impact
Resources required for incident mitigation (including sustaining incident operations as
well as system wide response and resource considerations)

The initial dispatch information is rarely complete. These situations can evolve rapidly, and it is
necessary to assume that the information, which is initially received, will change. It is important
to approach these incidents slowly and cautiously. High piled outside combustible storage fires
may grow quickly. Over‐committing prior to fully evaluating the critical factors can pose
significant danger to firefighters, as well as unnecessary damage to apparatus and equipment.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

High Piled Outside Combustible Storage Fires
M.P. 202.18

Page 3 of 4

The success of any fire suppression operation begins at the company level. The Company
Officer should familiarize his/her crew with all high piled outside combustible storage facilities
located within their area of response. Information gathered should be entered into the CAD
system for the specific locations allowing easy access on the MCT during response and for pre‐
incident planning in the station.
2. Risk Management System
It is critical that all hazard zone decisions are based on the application of the Risk Management
System.
This application will be continuously re‐assessed throughout the incident.




We will risk our lives a lot, in a calculated manner, to save SAVABLE lives.
We will risk our lives a little, in a calculated manner, to save SAVABLE property.
We will not risk our lives at all for lives or property that are already lost.

“Actions in a calculated manner” require the following:






Incident Command established (where applicable, refer to M.P. 201.01)
Proper personal protective equipment
Accountability system established (where applicable, refer to M.P. 201.03)
Safety procedures in place
Continuous risk assessment by all members

The use of this Risk Management System will improve the incident commander’s ability to
provide a more predictable, safe environment to achieve the tactical objectives. Fires involving
high piled outside combustible storage often burn and extend quickly. We will not risk our lives
at all for property that is already lost. All firefighters operating on these types of incidents
should employ a pessimistic application of the Risk Management System which includes
realistic forecasting.
3. Strategy
Strategy defines the operational posture of the incident. We are either operating in an
offensive or defensive strategy. An offensive strategy aimed at rescuing victims is unlikely in a
high piled outside combustible storage fire. More likely are offensive operations to save
property; however, there is typically a very small window in which offensive attacks could be
successful. Forecast how much the fire will grow, and in most cases, a defensive operation is
appropriate. Incident Commanders need to make sure all personnel operating on the incident
are aware of the strategy. Regardless of strategy, the first priority is firefighter safety, and there
is no reason to endanger firefighters during defensive operations.

4. Incident Action Plan
High piled outside combustible storage fires have the potential to be large scale incidents. The
incident action plan must be safe, well communicated and consistently evaluated against the
conditions and the effectiveness of the actions being taken. The incident action plan should
always match the strategy.




Offensive High Piled Outside Combustible Storage Fire Incident Action Plan: Quick
aggressive rescue, quick aggressive fire attack to stop the fire spread early, providing for
firefighter safety, and a continuous water supply throughout. Once rescue operations
are completed, pessimistic evaluation and forecasting of risk vs. gain will be applied to
offensive operations to save property.
Defensive high piled outside combustible storage fire incident action plan: Provide for
firefighter safety, identify main body of fire and paths for extension through pessimistic
forecasting, address exposures including public health, address environmental
protection, and extinguish fire using master streams, if appropriate.

5. Tactical Objectives







Firefighter Safety: Awareness of the hazards involved in high pile outside combustible
storage fire can be the best personnel protection. Firefighter safety is our top priority.
Rapid fire spread, toxic exposure, fatigue, heavy equipment, fire apparatus, and master
streams are some of the unique hazards on these incidents.
Exposure Protection: High piled outside combustible storage fires have a potential to
grow rapidly and threaten structural exposures and public health. Incident Commanders
should establish sectors early to protect exposures and evacuate if necessary.
Environmental Protection (including public health): There are many considerations
associated with environmental protection and public heath on high piled outside
combustible storage fires. Incident Commanders need to give careful consideration
regarding the material burning, and the consequences of letting the material burn vs.
fire suppression with big water. Hazmat units and environmental specialists like the
Arizona Department of Environmental Quality can assist Command with evaluation of
environmental protection and public health on these incidents.
Fire Control: Depending on the nature of the incident, fire control may be addressed in a
variety of ways. For example, fire suppression with big‐water, removing fuel from the
fire with heavy equipment, and letting the fire burn itself out are all acceptable
considerations for fire control. Emphasis should be placed on potential for fire spread
and exposure protection. Clean‐up will likely be turned over to an appropriate
environmental protection agency.

Overview
Tire fires present the same potential threat to the environment that an incident involving an oil
tanker or a railroad tank car carrying hazardous substances. The average passenger car tire
holds 2.5 gallons of oil. When exposed to extreme heat, the tires reach a state of combustion
where volumes of pyrolytic oil can be produced. This could turn the tire pile into a running oil
fire. Exposure hazards associated with the smoke plume, water runoff, and soil include:
•
•
•
•

Volatile organic chemicals
Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons
Carbon monoxide
Heavy metals

These toxins can be absorbed either through the skin, mucus membranes or respiratory system.
The success of any fire suppression operation begins at the company level. The Company
Officer should familiarize his/her crew with all scrap tire piles located within their area of
response. Information gathered should be entered into the CAD system
Areas of consideration during pre-planning should include:
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Site location
Type of operation
o Salvage or recycling
o Managed or unmanaged
Tire piles composition (e.g., whole, burned, shredded, random stack, etc.)
Tire pile size
Available equipment (e.g., backhoes, front-loaders, etc.)
Hazards
Exposures (e.g., storm drains and dry wells if applicable)
Utilities (e.g., overhead wires, underground gas lines, communication equipment,
etc.)

Deployment Considerations
It is recommended that major tire fires be handled as hazardous materials incidents. The
incident taker will obtain all available information from the caller to determine what is on fire. A
hazardous 3-1 will be dispatched if it is determined that a tire pile is on fire.
Size-Up
Upon arrival the Company Officer must determine the stage of combustion:
1. Incipient
2. Free burning
3. Smoldering
The incipient stage of a tire fire begins with a point of ignition. Once a tire has gained an open
flame front, the heat of the fire is absorbed by the surrounding tire material. Immediately
separating the burning tire from the rest of the pile and/or applying water and foam would
eliminate the threat to the remaining tires.
During the free burning stage, fire spreads quickly and there is a dramatic increase in smoke
and heat. Use of water in this stage of a tire fire could increase the products of incomplete
combustion like carbon monoxide and particulate matter. The cooled tires may continue to
pyrolize, producing large quantities of oil. A crust may form over the pile while internal
temperatures reach about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The smoldering stage has begun.
Oil not consumed by the fire will leach into the soil, pool, and begin to flow under the pile. Heat
from the fire could ignite the oil, resulting in a three-dimensional fire. Products of incomplete
combustion continue to be a health hazard.
During the initial size-up, the Company Officer has to determine if the fire can be extinguished
quickly without endangering personnel. If the fire is in the free burning or smoldering stage the
most immediate concern will be the life safety of Firefighters and the community. Approach to
the incident should be in accordance with tactics common to other potential hazardous
materials incidents.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES
M.P. 202.18A

Initial size-up should include the evaluation of the emergency in terms of:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Personnel safety
Public health
Environmental impact
Threatened exposures
Extent of fire
Need for additional resources

Personnel Safety
Awareness of the hazards involved in a tire fire can be the best personnel protection. Heat
exhaustion and working in less than ideal conditions is a reality in a large tire fire. Command
will want to prepare for total exposures, health hazards and personal injury hazards.
Full turnout gear is the minimum level of protection required for everyone working the tire fire.
1. Boots
2. Turnout pants
3. Turnout coat
4. Gloves
5. Helmet
6. Nomex hood
7. S.C.B.A. with Mask
NOTE: Conditions permitting E.M.S. gloves under the leather gloves will give added protection
from contact with the contaminated water, oil, and mud.
The risk of exposure to toxic chemicals continues after the fire is out. Smoldering tires are as
toxic as tires in a free burning state. Flying ash and contaminated soil are also potential hazards.
The temptation to dress down for overhaul should be resisted until the hazardous materials
team has determined the appropriate level of protective clothing required.
Command will establish a Lobby Sector to ensure personnel accountability. When multiple
points of entry to the incident exist, geographic sectors should be established (e.g., lobby north,
lobby east, etc.). Hazard sectors, zones and Rehab Sector will be established according to the
Standard Operating Procedures.
The Incident Commander will establish a Decontamination Sector for all personnel leaving the

fire area. All protective clothing, firefighting equipment and apparatus will need to be
decontaminated as well.
Sectors such as environmental, safety, PIO and any other sectors/branches listed under
"Command Concerns" in this procedure will be established as the incident progresses.
Personnel must be aware of other hazards involving scrap tire fires. Contact with rodents,
mosquitoes, snakes, spiders and scorpions will be reduced with protective clothing.
Be aware of the dangers of machinery and heavy equipment operating on the fire scene.
Collapsing walls of tires can block escape routes or cut off water supplies.
Public Health
Command should determine early whether to evacuate the surrounding areas. Tire fires are
extremely difficult to extinguish. Given this knowledge, no strategy for managing the incident
should bypass evacuation considerations.
Evacuation Sector should be established early. The process will be managed according to the
Evacuation Sector procedure (M.P. 201.05E).
Environmental Impact
Command should size-up the potential environmental consequences of the fire and begin
notifying the appropriate agencies. Emergency contacts can be notified according to the
Environmental Sector procedure (M.P. 201.05D). Early notification will facilitate their timely
placement into the Command structure and involvement in the incident.

Areas of concern will include:

Immediate evacuation of the incident scene is a high priority. Every effort should address life
safety of the incident scene. Protection of the fire crews safety will be addressed continuously.
On-deck crews will be established according to the In-Transit, On Deck, Company Recycle
procedure (M.P. 201.01A). Buildings, equipment and utilities in the proximity of the fire will
need to be protected. Command needs to determine the amount of fuel actively burning and
the total amount of fuel available. Estimate the rate of spread to determine what will be
allowed to burn and where fire breaks will be cut through the pile.
Creating fire breaks in a large tire pile is a long and time consuming process. It can be
accomplished with heavy machinery and front-end loaders. Use of City Equipment at
Emergency Scenes procedure will allow Command to implement the process (M.P. 206.15).

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES
M.P. 202.18A

Tire Fires
05/18

Page 6 of 8

Successful options for fighting a tire fire have been employed individually and in many cases, in
combination with one another. Reduced to the lowest common denominator, these options
are:
1. Burn it
2. Bury it
3. Drown it
Burn It
Letting a tire pile burn has its merits. Soil and water pollution may be drastically reduced
when many of the products of combustion go up in smoke. The clean up costs can be
reduced when compared to other options.
A precedent for the burn it strategy appears in fire responses to chemical fires. Adding
water to fires or hazardous materials which react to water could exacerbate the
emergency.
Importantly, the fire service must manage and control the burn. Protecting exposures
and separating tires from the burn area will continue to be a tactical priority.
Bury It
The decision to bury a tire pile also has merits. Sand, cement dust, quick lime, and
crushed coral rock are all high in calcium content. Calcium scrubs sulfur from the
emissions, creating calcium sulfate or gypsum.
The bury it strategy could be employed in areas that have minimal water supply or in
areas that are densely populated. The decision to bury a tire fire would take into
consideration reducing toxic smoke for the sake of public health.
Geological considerations play an important role in the bury it strategy. While the tire
fire is entombed, fires can still pyrolize and push toxic oil into the soil and underground
water sources. Burying a tire fire that is on top of clay soils may delay the oil from
filtering to underground water supplies. To determine the release of pyrolytic oil, check
down gradient from the pile for contamination.
Drown It

Water, foam, and additives have their own place as an option. The drown it strategy is
best employed with forethought and careful pre-planning. Knowing in advance the
topography and exposure hazards to water sources will be critical.
Drawbacks to the drown it strategy include:
•
•
•

An increase in the toxic air emissions as the fire is cooled causing the combustion
process to slow down.
An inordinate amount of water run-off combined with pyrolytic oil will be the
result of trying to drown out a fire.
Effectiveness of working lines applied to a tire fire is questionable. Handlines
alone cannot reach the interior spaces of a tire fire.

The use of working lines on chunk and chipped tires, however, can be effective when used in a
fog application. Here again, separating the inventory from the burn area is important to the
control and extinguishment of chipped and chunk tire materials.
The use of foam would best be employed on small tire fires or when the fire is in the incipient
stage. Pulling a larger tire pile apart with heavy machinery and applying foam would be a
prudent use of the product. Foam should only be employed as part of a predetermined
strategy.
Clean-Up and Overhaul
Unlike traditional structural fires or wildland fires, clean-up on tire fires will; in all probability,
be turned over to an appropriate environmental protection agency. Hazards to personnel exist
long after the fire is out. Toxicity levels of tire fire sites suggest high concentrations of
contaminates. Flying ash and contaminated soil blown around the site may increase your
exposure risks.

Mulch/Compost Fires

M.P. 202.18B

04/18

Page 1 of 2

Purpose
The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines for companies operating on incidents
involving mulch/compost fires. Mulch/compost fires pose a unique challenge for fire companies
due to the many different tactics needed to resolve these incidents.
Policy
The best practice to extinguish mulch/compost fires is to isolate the burning material by
removing the surrounding uninvolved material, spread out the burning material and then apply
water to only that material. Initial companies need to understand that these types of fires are
going to be Defensive. Incident Commanders should take their time in developing a plan and
realize that our standard quick, aggressive, offensive tactics will not work. Often application of
water is actually the worst thing we can do and only makes the incident more difficult to
control.
Procedure
The first arriving company will assume command and make access to the site (if necessary,
relay best access to AHQ). All other companies should stage appropriately. The Incident
Commander shall evaluate the Critical Fireground Factors, with an emphasis on determining if
this is an isolated mulch/compost fire or are there structural exposures to protect. The
following questions need to be asked during size up and when developing an Incident Action
Plan:








What type of fire and how large is it (i.e. small surface fire vs. deep seated fire)?
Are there exposures in immediate danger?
How far has the fire progressed?
What direction is the fire going, and what is the wind direction?
Is there heavy equipment and qualified operators on site (e.g. loaders, dozers, etc.)?
What are the water supply options (e.g. hydrants, daisy‐chains, drafting, tankers, etc.)?
What is the availability of additional resources and special equipment?

With Structural Exposure
For any fire larger than a small surface fire that the initial arriving unit cannot resolve, the
Incident Action Plan should be primarily determined by the presence of any immediate
exposures. If exposures exist, the Incident Commander should develop an Incident Action Plan
with a priority on exposure protection that accomplishes the following:
1. Location of a site manager or responsible party
2. Secure an uninterrupted water supply as needed
3. Assign companies to key positions to protect exposures (assigned companies need to be
aware of ground conditions and position apparatus appropriately)
4. Identification of an appropriate incident organization and sectors as needed
5. Only apply water as needed to protect exposures
6. Develop a plan to extinguish the burning mulch/compost
7. Request appropriate resources (e.g. Foam‐Truck, Hose‐Truck, Car99, ADEQ, RM50, PIO,
etc.)
Without Structural Exposure
If no exposures exist, the Incident Commander should develop an Incident Action Plan that
accomplishes the following:
1. Locate a site manager or responsible party
2. Secure an uninterrupted water supply as needed
3. Do not apply water to main pile of burning material, wait until pile is isolated
4. Develop a plan to isolate burning material using on‐site equipment, Car 99, etc.
5. Assign companies to key positions that allow for application of water to isolated
material (be aware of ground conditions when assigning units)
6. Identification of an appropriate incident organization and sectors as needed
7. Request appropriate resources (e.g. Foam‐Truck, Hose‐Truck, Car99, ADEQ, RM50, PIO,
etc.)
Operational Information
Fires in composting facilities are relatively common; fortunately, most facilities are able to
resolve small surface fires. Fires are started in one of two ways, internal combustion caused by
the breakdown of the organic materials or external ignition (lighting, sparks, smoking materials
and arson). Deep seated smoldering fires can actually burn for days before being detected.
These are the types of fires our fire companies typically will encounter.

C99 CAPABILITY AND FUNCTION
M.P. 202.19

11/19-N

Page 1 of 2

C99 is a response apparatus housed at Fire Prevention within the Phoenix Fire Department. It is staffed
by Deputy Fire Marshals that rotate on an A-B-C schedule to compliment the Fire Operations schedule.
C99 assists Fire Operations crews by remaining on scene of certain incidents in order to allow the crews
to return to service. C99 then contacts the property owners and responsible parties in order to coordinate
a resolution to the incident and legally transfer liability and risk back to the property owner or responsible
party through documentation. C99 is typically only dispatched at the discretion of the Company or
Command Officer managing the incident. Incidents that C99 can respond to are as follows:
SPRINKLER/ SUPPRESSION/ FIRE ALARM/ KITCHEN HOOD ANSUL / CO2 ACTIVATIONS OR
DAMAGE TO THESE SYSTEMS RENDERING THEM INOPERABLE
• Verify these systems have required life safety features and are installed correctly while operating
as designed
• Damaged systems require immediate restoration by licensed fire protection professional.
Systems that are unable to be restored to normal operating conditions will be documented and a
fire watch will be required
• Frequent false alarms or malfunctions, when reported by Fire Operations, will be followed up and
documented for correction
• Any CO2 alarm activation requires a C99 response. A false alarm or any leak will require an
inspection of the entire system
• Any sprinkler activation requires a C99 response to ensure the system is put back in service
SPILLS/ LEAKS/ ILLEGAL DUMPING
• If on City of Phoenix property, (easements, parcels) C99 will coordinate with City officials and the
Office of Environmental Programs to ensure the spill, leak or illegally dumped material is properly
disposed of
• If on private property or streets, C99 will identify the property owner or responsible party and
require them to contract with a qualified Hazardous Materials Cleanup contractor for proper
cleanup and disposal of said material
SICK BUILDINGS
• In the event multiple patients complain of the same general illness symptoms or if a patient
requires transport to the local emergency room from a suspected illness caused by the building
• C99 will evaluate the need for an industrial hygienist to investigate the building and assit in
dertermination if building access should be restricted
STRUCTUAL INTEGRITY ISSUES
• Vehicles into buildings, collapse or any instance where the integrity of a structure is being called
into question
• C99 will require the property owner or responsible party to contract with a structural engineer or
private contractor to shore up the structure until repairs can be made
• C99 will document the unsafe building and contact the Planning and Development
Department Structural Section for follow-up

ACCESS ISSUES
• When emergency response is inhibited or defects are discovered on gates, fences, fire doors,
Knox Boxes by Fire Operations
• C99 will discuss with crew via phone to determine if issue needs to be immediately addressed or
if Fire Prevention can follow-up during business hours.
OVERCROWDING
• C99 will respond to verify occupant load approved for the structure and ensure egress is
accessible
• C99 will limit entry until occupant load is reduced to a safe number
DAMAGED POOL FENCES
• When there is 18” of water or greater in a pool with a damaged or missing pool fence
• Front yard pools without barrier or fence present
• C99 can create a temporary barrier to prevent a potential drowning
• C99 may contact the Neighborhood Services Department for follow-up
C99 is automatically dispatched on overcrowding and CO2 alarms.

EMERGENCY ACCESS KEY USAGE AND FIRE ALARMS
M.P. 202.19A

11/19-N

Page 1 of 3

PURPOSE:
This procedure is intended to provide guidelines for usage of the high-security emergency access key
and determination of a course of action when dealing with activated fire alarms.
POLICY:
If an emergency access device is present, fire companies should utilize that device to access the
premises during emergency situations. Emergency access devices include: key boxes, preemption or
opticom detectors, key switches, and fire department pad-locks.
When responding to fire alarm indications, fire companies should size up the situation; if a key box is
present, fire companies should utilize the key box to access the property.
DEFINITIONS:
Emergency Access Keys are defined as those keys that allow access to buildings or equipment as
required by the Fire Code.
False alarm is defined as any activation of an alarm system because of human, mechanical, lack of
maintenance, negligent or electrical error.
PROCEDURE:
1. The first arriving unit shall do a size up to determine if a visible emergency exists (water, smoke,
or flames visible).
a. Look for a red bell on the outside of the building. If the bell is ringing, water is very likely
to be flowing out of the fire sprinkler system.
2. Formally establish command when appropriate (see M.P. 201.01 Command Procedures).
3. If a visible emergency situation exists, take appropriate actions for the type of occupancy involved.
4. If no visible emergency exists, request that the Alarm Room verify with the alarm company that a
responsible party has been contacted and is responding.
5. Check the premise for a key box. If key box is present and has functional key inside, access the
building.
a. If a key box is not present or functional keys to access the building are not provided, fire
companies should determine if forcible entry is necessary based on size up. These
decisions are made on a case-by-case basis and are founded on protecting property. The
Fire Department will not be held liable for damages as a result of not forcing entry or
forcing entry if a key box or functional keys are not provided.
b. Proceed to the Fire Alarm Control Panel to determine the status of the alarm system and
indicate possible reasons for the fire alarm activation (alarm, trouble, or zone). Also, this
will assist with identifying the location(s) of the alarm system device(s) that may be causing
the alarm.

6. While a systematic investigation of the premises is taking place to determine the device(s) that
activated the system, the Fire Alarm Control Panel can be silenced if a switch exists to do so, but
under no circumstance should the panel reset button be pushed at this time.
a. If water, smoke, of flames are found during the investigation take appropriate action for
the occupancy involved.
7. If after the investigation has been completed and a determination of what caused the system to
activate cannot be found, allow the alarm system to remain in silence mode until the emergency
contact person responsible for the occupancy resets the system.
8. If it has been determined that a pull station was inadvertently activated and there are no other
devices activated, firefighters may reset the pull station if possible and the alarm system.
9. If the emergency contact person is not responding or has extended ETA, firefighters may reset
the system and go back in service. We cannot have fire companies unavailable on calls where
no indication of an emergency exists.
a. The company officer should relay the alarm conditions to the building occupants if present.
10. False alarms should be recorded in the FIR system so that appropriate billing and follow up can
occur. The company officer should complete all appropriate fields in the FIR and submit it within
the same shift. False alarms should be categorized in one of the following four incident types:
a. Alarm system sounded due to malfunction
b. Smoke detector activation due to malfunction
c. Sprinkler activation due to malfunction
d. Extinguishing system activation due to malfunction
11. If at any time fire companies require assistance or if there was a fire protection system activation,
contact C99 via the Alarm Room. An example of a fire protection system activation is a fire
sprinkler flowing water in the building.
OPERATIONAL INFORMATION:
Selecting one of the incident types for false alarm reporting will automatically generate a report to the
Phoenix Police Department Code Enforcement Unit (PDCEU). The Police Department handles all
warning letters, billing and collections as outlined in the City of Phoenix Code. Standard residential smoke
detectors that are not monitored by a third-party company are not subject to any fee but should still be
reported with the above incident types for tracking and customer service follow-up.
Fire Prevention (FP) provides a follow-up inspection in occupancies that have had ten false alarms
reported in any 365-day period. The notification to FP that an occupancy has had ten alarms is
automatically generated when the appropriate incident type is recorded in the FIR system. Fire
Prevention can provide in-person follow-up with the occupancy owner earlier if requested by the company
officer by contacting Fire Prevention at (602) 262-6771.

Smoke detector activation is typically indicated by a L.E.D. located on the smoke detector that remains
constantly illuminated. In some cases, the L.E.D. flashes rapidly when the smoke detector is activated.
Compare all smoke detector devices to assist in determining if the detector is activated or not.
Heat (thermal) detectors have no visible means of determining if they are activated.
Pull stations will typically have the activation lever pulled down or out to indicate activation. Some pull
station devices that have glass rods will have the broken rod lying on the floor beneath the pull station.

PURPOSE
The purpose of the procedure is to describe the unique operational considerations that mid-rise
structures and occupancies pose for fire operations. These considerations are specific to these
types of structures and differ from the more traditional apartment buildings/complexes as well as
from high rise buildings. These considerations come in the form of construction materials and
building practices, interior layout, fire protection systems, and building systems. These structures
require specific operational attention for initial arriving companies in locating the fire, attacking
the fire, and protecting and/or removing endangered occupants. These considerations present
safety concerns that are specific to these buildings and challenge standard safety practices for
other occupancy types.
Preplanning is critical for successful operations in these buildings. Because of the broad spectrum
of construction practices, size, and configurations it is necessary to expect the unexpected.
As in any other structure, the ability of the Phoenix Fire Department to extinguish the fire as quickly
as reasonably possible improves the conditions for any possible victims and the safety of the
firefighters. All firefighting operations in mid-rise buildings should be built around this fact.
MID-RISE DEFINITION
For the purposes of Phoenix Regional Standard Operating Procedures, a mid-rise is defined as
anything below 75’ in height and greater than 3 stories. The City of Phoenix currently has
residential and commercial mid-rise buildings in our city and in our neighboring communities.
Mid-rise structures have different fire protection system standards than high-rise structures. The
mid-rise fire protection standards in the fire code are dependent on construction features and
elements hence is not the same across all mid-rise buildings.

MID-RISE SIZE UP AND FIREGROUND FACTORS
Preplanned information and a thorough size up are critical to early success for fires in mid-rise
buildings. There are many unique critical factors for mid-rise structures that impact fire attack,
rescue operations, and firefighter safety. Early recognition of the fireground factors and
appropriate action to limit the fire growth and the impact to victims is fundamental. The size up
should include all means of rescue and access from the most advantageous position. Fire
conditions should be assessed for the best position of a fire attack. Size up should also include
the recognition of structural involvement as early as possible with a pessimistic perspective.
Size-up in mid-rise structures should begin with the standard, fundamental size-up questions, and
drive to the recognition of the unique challenges presented at each individual incident.
The critical factors for mid-rise include but aren’t limited to:
•

Life Safety
o Residential mid-rise structures can have high density occupancy
o Rapid evaluation of removing the fire from the victims or the victims from the
fire is critical and should not delay an effective fire attack
o Commercial mid-rise occupancies should be evaluated for the presence of life
safety and managed as an action of opportunity and should not delay an
effective fire attack
o Rescues may be required from exterior positions dependent on the conditions
and the ability of victims to escape
o Many mid-rises have roof top common spaces that have the potential for high
population density at any given time

•

Fire and Smoke Conditions
o Nothing showing means nothing
o It is likely to have a serious fire with no external signs on arrival
o Ventilation limited conditions are a significant possibility due to tightly sealed
buildings
o Recognition of building openings are critical in measuring the flow path potential
o Wind driven conditions are a distinct possibility of floors above ground level
o Determination of smoke and fire conditions in common hallways and stairwells
is critical in determining the life safety impact and difficulty of a fire attack

•

Access
o Mid-rise structures do not typically have lobby level, centralized entrance that
provides access to the entire structure
o Mid-rise structures typically have multiple entrance points for different
geographical areas of the building

•

Not all access points and stairwells will have standpipes or sprinkler control
systems
Evaluate the presence of exterior access points from balconies via aerial
apparatus
Floor access can come from multiple points
The fire code does not require the availability of keys or key fobs for all areas of
the structure
The fire code requires keys be present for only these places:
 Pools
 Utility/Mechanical/Electrical rooms
 Fire sprinkler riser room
 Fire alarm control panel rooms
 Stairwells
 Roof access
 Non-standard elevator keys

Building Systems
o Mid-rise structures typically do not have a Fire Control Room as in high rise
buildings
o A fire alarm panel is required in all new construction since 2002, and are typically
located at the main entrance, in and around the building management offices
o Some older mid-rise buildings do not have a standard fire alarm panel
o There may be no fire alarm panels or displays in any exterior or remote entrance
points to the building
o Mid-rise structures built since 2002 are required to be sprinklered
o The location and number of sprinkler heads is determined by the construction
methods and features of the specific building
o Mid-rise buildings do not typically have fire pumps unless unique building or
water issues are present
o Mid-rise buildings typically use city water pressure for the wet sprinkler systems
and for the standpipe systems (when a combination system is present)
o Standpipes may not be present in every stairwell
o Standpipe supply connections may be at one specific location or decentralized
depending on the footprint of the building
o Standpipe connections may be present in interior hallways due to the length of
the hallway or the distance from the stairwell standpipe connections
o Some standpipe connections can be up to 200’ apart depending on the sprinkler
system in the building
o Fire department connections (FDC) and interior standpipe connections may have
KNOX locking caps in place and require the “dog bone” keys for access

Wet standpipe systems with city water pressure above ground level may have
inadequate water volume and pressure to mount an effective fire attack
Elevators in mid-rise buildings may not have centralized elevator monitoring in
the lobby
Elevators may not recall in all areas if alarm occurs in a specific location
Mid-rise buildings typically do not have floor and stairwell pressurization or
smoke evacuation systems
Smoke detectors are typically found in residential units and at the elevator
lobby(s)
Automatic closing fire/smoke doors can be present in long hallways that are
initiated by the fire alarm
Each residential unit will typically have independent HVAC systems that are not
tied to the building systems
Commercial mid-rise buildings may have centralized HVAC systems with central
monitoring and/or control
Security systems are common and can have multi-layered approaches requiring
keys or a key fob for access from the exterior and then onto individual floors and
units
Stairwells may not connect to all floors depending on the footprint of the
building
Roof access is required however not standard in location
Gate arms and barricades leading to parking garages may be present and are
sometimes added after final construction inspection

•

Occupancy type
o Residential mid-rise occupancies typically have an interior hallway layout with
independent units on both sides of the hallways
o Some residential mid-rises have multi story/level units
o Residential units can be configured in many layouts with open floor plans
o Commercial mid-rise occupancies have multiple configurations ranging from
center hallway to open floor plans
o Many mid-rise buildings have a combination of business on the lower level and
residential on top
o The lower level may not have interior communication/access to the upper levels

•

Building construction
o Mid-rise buildings have many different construction types
o Modern residential mid-rise occupancies combine masonry and concrete in the
lower level and wood framed construction in the upper levels
o Wood framed mid-rise structures are combustible and the structural integrity
will erode if the fire extends into the structure

•

Modern residential mid-rise occupancies can have multiple roof types
depending on the construction methods
Residential mid-rise units can range in size from small (< 1,000 square feet) to
very large (> 3,000 square feet)
Overall building size can have a large impact on operations as well as large
number of occupants
Some buildings take up entire city blocks in size
Commercial mid-rise occupancies can have a more standard steel and
lightweight concrete construction closely related to high rise construction
Modern mid-rise buildings are sealed tightly and resist exterior/interior air
exchange to improve energy efficiency for cooling
Some mid-rise buildings have exterior opening window or doors however not
all
Many mid-rise buildings have underground parking directly beneath the overall
footprint of the building
Many mid-rise buildings have recreational spaces on the roof including pools,
recreation rooms, and bars

Resources
o Dependent on the smoke and fire conditions and the life safety potential, a rapid
determination of the required resources is necessary
o Resources should be considered for external rescue and access
o It will be necessary to appropriately support the fire floor for fire attack and
rescue, the floor above for rescue and fire extension, and the critical exposures
for loss control
o Consideration should be given for staging resources close enough to the
building and access points to decrease the in transit time and to not congest key
tactical positions
o It is possible to develop an incident organization with significant complexities
and the utilization of branches should be considered

STRATEGIC LEVEL CONSIDERATIONS
As in most fireground scenarios, the better the decision making and initial actions at mid-rise fires
from the beginning, the more likely of the most positive outcome. Effective evaluation of the
incident conditions and the ability to locate the fire as quickly as possible are foundational to
effective operations. A pessimistic evaluation of the required resources to manage an effective
fire attack and provide for the rescue or isolation of victims, on potentially multiple floors, is
critical.
A focus on locating the fire as early as possible allows for the most effective identification of the
critical tactical positions. Effective sectorization improves the span of control, supervision of
MID RISE OPERATIONS
Page 5 of 10

critical work, and command safety. Clear functional or positional sector assignments will improve
the work outcomes and the safety of the firefighters working.
To execute the possibility of exterior rescues, apparatus placement becomes a critical
consideration. The ability of aerial ladders, platforms, and ground ladders to access areas with
rescue situations requires the consideration of the making those apparatus locations a priority. It
will be necessary to provide access for multiple ladder companies to make simultaneous rescues
when necessary, and search from exterior access points. These locations are also a consideration
for access to initiate a fire attack if interior access is delayed.
Exterior aerial apparatus should also be considered for standpipe operations if an interior attack
is delayed, or interior conditions won’t allow safe operations with hose stretch distances and
SCBA air consumption. In these instances, effective water supply, appropriate hose and nozzle
selection is critical. The critical positions that must be considered include:

are in progress
 Consider multiple crews in attack teams
 Allow for sufficient time to complete
 Should not be confused with a primary search to achieve an all clear
 Should not be conducted with smoke and fire conditions present (IDLH)
without hose lines or the use of SCBA’s
Human factors
 Occupants may not shelter in place
 May attempt to exit the building floor via most familiar routes
Clearly identify attack and evacuation stairwells from each floor

The recognition of secondary tactical positions to support the initial fire attack and rescue efforts
includes:
• Triage
• Extrication
• Treatment
• Transportation
• Ventilation
• Building systems
• Occupant Services
TACTICAL LEVEL CONSIDERATIONS
Effective tactical level (sector) management is the balance of decisive action to extinguish the fire,
protect life safety, and effectively manage the safety and welfare of the operating crews. This
includes clear plans to establish an effective fire attack with adequate water, remove and/or protect
the victims, or support these actions from other positions. Sector management should include the
following considerations:

Development of a plan for exterior rescue with adequate resources that are capable of
these functions
Development of a plan to extinguish or support the extinguishment of the fire as quickly
as possible
Development of a plan to manage or support the rescue and/or protection in place
Development of a plan for thorough fire extension investigation in all exposed areas
Establishing and maintaining effective access
Establish and maintain effective water supply
Establish and maintain an area of safe refuge for fire companies
Direct coordination with other Sector Officers
Manage position and function of all units assigned to Sector
Provide for 3 deep resource layers of working, on-deck, and recycling
Accountability can be conducted via radio when required

Sector management must be done from a position outside of the smoke and fire conditions.
Sector Officers attempting to operate in smoke and heat conditions are not able to effectively
manage the work and communications when attempting to manage their own accountability and
air consumption.
It is possible the building layout could require hose stretches of more than 150 feet. When this
occurs a clear assessment of the required action and the position in the risk management plan is
critical.

The simple expectation is that no fire company should operate on the interior of any structure,
during firefighting operations, beyond their ability to retreat to an area of safe refuge prior to
their low air alarm going off.
TASK LEVEL CONSIDERATIONS
Task level considerations for fires in mid-rise structures is built on sound decision making,
fundamental task completion, and effective air management. They involve understanding the task
level functions that are assigned and executing them within a plan or in coordination with other
companies to achieve the tactical objectives.
Task level considerations should include:
• Size up and Decision Making
o Assessing fire and smoke conditions and behavior
o Assessing flow path conditions
o Hoseline selection for reach and appropriate water volume
o Assessing for the presence of wind driven conditions
o Effective size up for most critical areas requiring search simultaneously with fire
attack

CRITICAL SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
Mid-rise structures pose unique safety concerns for firefighters. They have unique features unlike
high rise or more common apartment buildings. The greatest safety challenges include up to 6
stories of combustible building material, fire travel in void spaces, structural integrity under fire
conditions, and interior layouts requiring hose stretches greater than 150 feet.
The absolute best action for potential victims and the safety of firefighters at any fire is to
extinguish the fire as quickly as possible in its smallest state. Specifically, the best operation at a
mid-rise fire is to extinguish the fire as quickly as possible to protect savable victims as well as
decrease the likelihood of structural involvement and fire extension to other compartments. This
requires effective size up to recognize when an aggressive, overwhelming fire attack is the best
plan. It also requires recognition of when conditions are beyond the ability to control effectively
by a standard interior fire attack.

MID RISE OPERATIONS
Page 9 of 10

When operating in an Offensive Strategy and conducting an interior fire attack and rescue
operations, special consideration must be taken for structural integrity of floors surfaces and floor
joists separating floors. Any fire involvement in these spaces can create localized failure and
create opportunities for falls through the floor. The fire code requires sprinklers in the floor joist
space when the joists/trusses are open web design. It does not require sprinklers in these spaces
when the joists/trusses are solid (such as TJI joists). Areas with plumbing or air duct pass
throughs is often opportunities for fire travel and weakening of the joist and structural members
surrounding them. Floor integrity is often a concern in bathrooms and kitchens. It is difficult to
know this information without preplanning and investigation.
When fire has spread into the structural members of a wood framed mid-rise building, this is a
very dangerous situation. The loss of key structural members due to fire damage can significantly
impact the overall structural stability of the entire building. Recognition of fire involving the
structure should be reported to Command immediately. The Sector Officer and Command must
determine if it safe and reasonable to continue in an Offensive Strategy. They must consider
whether it is possible to write off portions of the structure or it requires writing off the entire
building. A multi-story building with structural members burning is a dangerous situation.
Complex interior layouts with long interior hallways provide challenges for hose stretches of
greater than 150 feet and effective air management. Standpipe outlet placement in stairwells and
wall outlets in interior hallways are a necessary component to making a fire attack. When these
are positioned in a manner that is greater than 150 feet from the fire occupancy/compartment,
special consideration must be made for a fire attack and the ability to effectively manage adequate
SCBA air while executing fire control and an all clear. Firefighters running out of air in
contaminated atmosphere is not an option.
Fire radio communications may experience challenges in mid-rise buildings. This will depend on
the location of crews working on the interior as well as the size and building construction methods
present. This may require similar communication work arounds such as in high rise buildings
including radio to radio relaying. Interior tactical positions may need to evaluate their location
based on the communication abilities to manage the command system integrity. It is critical that
all mid-rise fire operations always be conducted on hazard zone radio channels.

Lithium-Ion Batteries are found in many consumer products today. Examples of where they are
found is cell phones, electric scooters and bicycles, even residential garage door openers often
have a Lithium-Ion battery backup built in. This policy/procedure is intended to provide direction
on handling these devices when they have been impacted either through radiated heat, direct
flame contact, or physical damage.
The hazards of Lithium-Ion batteries are well documented, they represent an increased risk to
building occupants and firefighters when they have failed, gone into thermal runaway or when
they have been damaged. Some of the hazards are toxic and flammable gases, height heat release
rates, the potential for projectiles and the threat of delayed ignition which can cause a secondary
ignition.
Fire hazards are relevant in the following two areas of response:
1. Initial Fire Attack, the involvement of Lithium-Ion batteries has the potential to dramatically
impact fire growth rates.
2. Heat impacted Lithium-Ion batteries can have a delayed failure that represents a secondary
ignition source.
PERSONAL MOBILITY LITHIUM-ION FIRE SOG
RESPONSE/MITIGATION
Develop an Incident Action Plan (IAP) to complete the Tactical Objectives.
• The primary fire attack with minimum 1 ¾” fire hose with water.
• Full PPE with facepiece. Consider a water supply if the batteries are continuing to propagate
into thermal runaway.
• Upgrade to a 3-1 Hazmat.
PERSONAL MOBILITY DEVICES AND LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES
Page 1 of 3

•

•

Extinguishment with Foam or ABC extinguishers is contraindicated.
The batteries can be submerged in a bathtub or bucket of water to cool them and limit the
products of combustion and allow to develop a more detailed IAP coordinated with
HAZMAT.
Even after extinguishment or submersion the batteries can still off gas and ignite.

ISOLATION
After extinguishment a thorough search of the area for exposed, damaged, burned batteries must
be performed prior to any overhaul. Batteries could have ruptured dispersing many smaller cells
throughout the room or area. It is important to locate and remove all batteries to prevent a
secondary fire. This is easiest done prior to burying them in overhaul debris.
• Full PPE will be worn with face piece and a charged hose line in place.
• Scan the fire affected area to identify any heat impacted Lithium-Ion batteries.
• Remove these batteries using buckets or containers.
• Consider submerging in water, or overpacking.
Note: The investigation of fires and the determination of their cause is a responsibility of the
Phoenix Fire Department (or automatic aid partner authority having jurisdiction). The primary
reason for the investigation of fires is for the collection of information regarding the origin and
cause. The origin and cause of a fire is determined to prevent similar occurrences in the future. If
the origin and cause investigation indicate that the fire may have been intentionally set, the
investigation is expanded to collect evidence related to a crime.
When possible, overhaul operations should be appropriately coordinated to prevent the
destruction of evidence necessary for the determination of the origin and cause of the fire.
Please continue to remain dedicated to scene preservation to prevent the destruction of critical
evidence at the fire scene. In most cases, this is as simple as remaining cognizant of scene
preservation during overhaul operations.
Some of the observations that we make at fire incidents may lead us to consider contacting a fire
investigator. If you have any reason to believe the cause of any fire to be suspicious, please contact
the Fire Investigations Section as soon as possible through the Alarm Room.
REMOVAL OF BATTERIES
Ongoing thermal runaway and electrocution hazards due to stranded energy should always be
considered. Whenever handling or near the batteries full PPE must be worn with a charged hose
line in place.
• Avoid hand carrying the batteries. Utilize buckets, shovels, tarps, and nonconductive tools.
• If the occupancy is on upper floors, consider using a Fire Department aerial device to lower
the batteries to the ground.
PERSONAL MOBILITY DEVICES AND LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES

•

The use of elevators or enclosed stairwells should be avoided.
Some personal mobility devices can be larger (Electric Wheelchair). The use of a thermal
blanket should be considered if forced to remove the batteries through interior areas.

OVERPACKING
Depending on the size of the mobility device the batteries may need to be removed or cut away
from the E bike, scooter, hoverboard, etc. The use of extrication tools or saws may be employed.
This tactic must be coordinated with the IC, Safety and Hazmat and should be done outside with
a charged hose line, and full PPE. When possible, Lithium-Ion batteries should be placed in a metal
vented container, to prevent the buildup of pressure. The metal container should be rated for the
Watts the battery produces (Volts X Amps = Watts).
• Place a small amount of Cellblock, dirt, or other thermal regulating material in the bottom
of the container then cover it with more of the same material.
• This should be done by Hazmat Techs or clean up contractors.
TERMINATION OF THE EVENT
The potential for a secondary fire due to stranded energy should always be considered. Command
Officers should:
• Time stamp through alarm that the owner/manager has been made aware of the
requirement to use a proper Hazmat disposal contractor.
• Consider the need to keep a crew on scene through the investigation phase.
• Consider having the Fire Department coordinate the removal of batteries from high
risk/high density occupancies.
• Only certified/permitted disposal companies can transport damaged Lithium-Ion batteries.

Scope
This procedure establishes a standard structure and guideline for the operation of Fire Department
units at multi-patient/mass casualty incidents. The system may be applied to any multi-patient or mass
casualty incident regardless of the number of patients or incident size. This procedure shall be
integrated into the overall incident management system and may included major transportation
incidents, explosions or fire with multiple injuries, hazardous materials incidents with exposure victims
and structural collapse incidents.
Policy Statement
The policy is to integrate the multi-patient/mass casualty procedures within the framework of the
incident management system. It is the responsibility of the first-arriving company officer to implement
these procedures on EMS incidents requiring the commitment of a two-and-one medical (2-1-M) or
greater.
For the purposes of this procedure, a “multi-patient incident” is defined as any incident with fewer than
twenty (25) patients. A "mass casualty incident” is defined as any incident involving 25 to 100 patients.
A “disaster” is defined as any incidents involving more than 100 patients.
Procedure
The first-arriving company officer at the scene of a multi-patient or mass casualty incident shall
establish Command. The initial Incident Commander (IC) shall remain in Command until Command is
transferred or the incident is stabilized and Command is terminated. Command is responsible for the
completion of the tactical objectives. The general tactical objectives, listed in order of priority, are:
1. Remove endangered occupants and treat the injured.
2. Stabilize the incident and provide for life safety.
3. Ensure the functions of triage, extrication, treatment and transportation are established as needed
and performed appropriately.
4. Provide for the safety, accountability and welfare of rescue personnel and victims.
5. Conserve property.
In addition, the EMS TACTICAL objectives to be completed during any multi-patient/mass casualty
incident include:
1. Completion of a “Triage Report”
2. Declaration of “All IMMEDIATES Transported”
The Incident Management System is used to facilitate the completion of the tactical objectives. The IC
is the person who drives the Command system towards that end. The IC is responsible for building a
command structure that matches the organizational needs of the incident to achieve the tactical
priorities.

When possible, patients should be treated and transported in the following priority order:
1. IMMEDIATE
2. DELAYED patients upgraded to IMMEDIATE

3. DELAYED
4. MINOR

Basic Operational Approach
The initial actions of the first arriving officer shall be directed toward scene size-up, requesting
appropriate resources and initial organization of the scene. Initial actions include:
1. Give an on-scene report and assume command. Initiate triage.
2. Perform a rapid hazard assessment and establish a safe zone to operate.
Initiate traffic control and provide a safe work/treatment area.
3. Provide for occupant protection (charged hand line).
4. Call for additional resources.
5. Radio a Triage Report to Dispatch.
6. Stabilize hazards and/or remove patients to a treatment area.
7. Assign crew(s) specific task(s) to accomplish.

8. Early sectorization (triage, extrication, treatment, and transportation) or by location (north, south, east, west).
9. Initiate patient assessment and treatment functions.

10. Coordinate patient transportation.

Responding personnel are encouraged to use triage tags and IMMEDIATE labels on smaller multipatient incidents. Triage tags should be used any time there are three (3) or more IMMEDIATE patients
or more than ten (10) patients. In the multi-patient incident scenario, most often a multiple vehicle
collision, use of the Central Arizona triage system (See MP 1201.14) can greatly improve initial scene
organization, and enhance its use during mass casualty incidents.
Arrival
The first arriving company officer at a multiple patient incident will assume Command and give an on
scene report which will answer the question. . . What do I have? What action will I take? What
resources do I need? The type of situation and the approximate number and condition of patients
should be communicated to Dispatch as soon as possible.
Command should rapidly survey the scene to identify any hazards or safety concerns and establish a
safe zone for crews to operate. This can be accomplished through proper defensive rig positioning,
use of flashing lights and the placement of flares or reflectors. Additional traffic control should be
requested from law enforcement through Dispatch.
Command should immediately request additional assistance if the need is indicated. Dispatch will
begin to notify other agencies and medical facilities based on the amount of assistance requested at
the scene and the progress reports from Command. The initial reports should indicate the scale of the
incident to allow Dispatch to notify other agencies.

Page 3 of 9

Triage will be initiated early in an incident, especially when the number of patients and/or the severity of
their injuries exceeds the capabilities of the on scene personnel to provide effective extrication,
treatment and transportation.
Once triage is complete, a Triage Report should be radioed to Alarm. A Triage Report at a two-vehicle
collision may sound like: “Triage to Command. Triage is complete. We have 9 total patients: 2
IMMEDIATES, 3 DELAYED and 4 MINORS.” A Triage Report signifies that triage has been completed
and communicates to all responding crews the size of the major medical incident. It also provides
essential information regarding decisions to call for additional resources or to scale back the response.
The first arriving company officer needs to quickly determine the most effective means to treat patients.
In incidents with few patients, it may be more effective to treat patients “in place.” At EMS incidents
with a greater number of patients, a treatment area should be established. In a case where two or
more distinct groups of patients are separated by distance, multiple treatments areas may be needed.
Treatment area(s) can be clearly identified by using colored salvage covers (red, yellow and green) to
designate treatment areas for IMMEDIATE, DELAYED or MINOR patients.
If the incident involves a building collapse or a hazardous material release, it may be more effective to
remove victims to a safe area rather than stabilize hazards. This is also true of motor vehicle collisions
involving a train wreck or bus. In these cases, triage will be performed at the entrance to the treatment
area.
Staging
Additional Resources should be requested using standard assignments and alarms as much as
possible (e.g., 2-1 Medical, 1st Alarm Medical, 2nd Alarm Medical, etc.) This will facilitate an
incremental approach to the incident, similar to firefighting operations, and provide predictable
resources.
The first arriving company will go to the scene, as well as the first paramedic unit, first ladder, first chief
officer, and first rescue. All other companies will use Level I staging upon their arrival.
Command should consider implementing Level II Staging early in the incident. All First-Alarm-Medical
Incidents (or greater) require a Level II Staging Area for all fire department resources, including rescue
companies.
All outside agencies responding to a medical incident should be sent to the Staging Area. This area
should be at a sufficient distance to keep the scene clear and maintain access. Staging officer will
assign units as directed by Command.
Units assigned to sectors, unless carrying special equipment, should park at a distance from the scene.
This parking area should be located out of the access paths. Crews should report to Extrication or
Treatment Sectors carrying their medical equipment. If a treatment area is designated, medical
equipment and supplies should be stockpiled there.

Basic Sectors
Most multiple-patient incidents require patient triage, extrication, treatment, and transportation.
Because of potential vehicle congestion at the site, a staging sector for apparatus is also a major
consideration during larger incidents.
These needs form natural basic sectors for the Incident Management System. Additional sectors may
be assigned depending on the situation, consistent with the Incident Management System.
The purpose of Triage Sector is to determine, in close coordination with Extrication, the location,
number and condition of patients and whether triage should be performed before or after patients are
extricated from the site. Triage is also responsible to assign and supervise triage teams, ensure that
patient triage is done in accordance with standard operating procedures and provide Command with a
“Triage Report” when triage is completed. Triage Sector should also forward triage tracking slips to
Command.
The purpose of Extrication Sector is to determine, in conjunction with Triage, the location, number and
condition of patients and whether triage will be performed before or after patients are extricated from
the impact area. Extrication is also responsible to assign and supervise extrication teams, extricate
and deliver patients to the treatment area, and notify Command when all patients have been removed
from impact area. MINOR patients who were directed earlier in the incident by triage teams to an
Assembly Area will be assessed by Extrication and delivered to the treatment area if further medical
care is warranted.
The purpose of Treatment Sector is to first determine whether patient treatment will occur “in place” or
in a designated treatment area. Generally, a centralized treatment area is preferred, as patient care
and site operations are substantially enhanced.

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

If a treatment area is designated, Treatment Sector may decide to treat patients in a common area.
However, if the incident is large enough treatment may designate separate "IMMEDIATE" and
"DELAYED" treatment areas. Treatment is responsible to assign and supervise treatment teams,
ensure that all patients have been triaged, assessed and treatment needed. Treatment Sector officer
should coordinate patient allocation with Transportation Sector and notify Command when all patients
have been treated.
The purpose of Transportation Sector is to obtain all modes of transportation needed to take patients to
the hospital. Transportation should determine, in conjunction with Command, the location of the staging
area, rescue loading area and helicopter landing zone. Transportation Sector is also responsible to
determine hospital availability through the Dispatch Center, coordinate patient allocation with Treatment
and supervise the movement of patients from the treatment area to the ambulance loading area or
helicopter landing zone.
Transportation Sector should also determine hospital destination and notify hospitals of rescue or
ambulance arrival (through Dispatch). Transportation should also remove patient tracking slips from
the triage tag prior to transport, notify Command when all Immediate patients have been transported
(an EMS Tactical benchmark) and maintain an accounting of all patients.
ADDITIONAL SECTORS
Safety Sector
Command should assign Safety Sector as soon as the basic sectors have been established.
As the incident escalates, a Staging Sector may be required. To avoid scene congestion, a Level II
staging area will be identified for any First Alarm Medical incident.
Medical Supply Sector is responsible for the procurement, delivery and stockpiling of medical supplies
needed at the scene. This sector should be established on 3rd Alarm Medical or greater incidents, as
Medical Support 19 (from the airport) and a Medical Supply truck (from Resource Management) will
automatically be dispatched. These units will have medical supplies, oxygen refill capability and
oxygen distribution system.
If helicopters are used, an LZ Sector will be established with a landing zone a safe distance from the
scene. LZ Sector will keep track of patient destination, communicate landing instructions with incoming
and outgoing aircraft and enforce established safety standards for landing zones (Brush Fire Air
Support). At least one Engine Company will be assigned to the LZ.
Branches
A mass casualty incident may require the implementation of a separate “Medical Branch” and
“Transportation Branch.” Each would direct all sectors assigned and report to Command.

The Medical Branch Director is responsible to ensure that the functions of triage, extrication, and
treatment are carried out. The Medical Branch Director should supervise and coordinate personnel
assigned, determine and request resources needed and recommend the expansion of the command
organization as needed. Medical Branch should communicate direction and objectives to tactical units,
ensure objectives are completed and maintain incident documentation.
Additional positions within the Medical Branch may include an IMMEDIATE, DELAYED and MINOR
Treatment Sector Officers, Medical Communications Sector, Medical Supply Sector, Ground
Ambulance Coordinator and Morgue Officer.
Resource Commitment and Flow
Resource commitment typically follows patients. Initially, Extrication will required a large resource
commitment. As patients are extricated and moved to Treatment, resources for extrication will
decrease. These crews can be re-allocated to the Treatment function.
In a disaster level incident, some fire department resources may need to be allocated to receiving hospitals until
those facilities can obtain adequate hospital staff.

TRIAGE SECTOR

M.P. 203.02

11/24-R

Page 1 of 3

PURPOSE
The purpose of triage is to identify the number of patients, categorize them based on the
severity of their injuries, prioritize their need for treatment and transportation needs, and
stabilize life-threatening injuries until additional resources arrive on the scene.

POLICY
Triage can be used on any sized incident at the discretion of the incident commander. If the
number of immediate patients exceeds the available resources for appropriate treatment,
Rapid Assessment of Mental status and Pulse (RAMP) triage should be implemented to sort
the patients. If either Command or Triage Sector determines the need for RAMP, emergency
traffic should be declared so that all responding and on-scene units know RAMP is being
utilized.
Triage, extrication, treatment, and transportation sectors can be assigned separately, which
clearly distinguishes between 4 important distinct functions. Each sector can be assigned as
needed based on the incident:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Triage: Identifying patient number and severity.
Extrication: Victim disentanglement and removal to a treatment area.
Treatment: Assess, treat, and prepare for hospital transport.
Transportation: Continued treatment and care through emergency transport to the
hospital.

Triage Sector Responsibilities
The following items represent the standard operations that will be performed by the Triage
Sector officer:
1. Determine the location, number, and condition of patients.
2. Request additional resources from Command based on patient needs.
3. When triage is complete, provide Command with a “Triage Report”. A Triage
Report should include the number of immediate and delayed patients.
4. Determine, in close coordination with Extrication Sector, if triage will be performed in
place or at the entrance to the treatment area and communicate the plan to
command.
5. Assign and supervise triage teams.
6. Conduct patient triage based on RAMP triage, ensuring that life-saving emergency
medical care is provided as needed (i.e., placing tourniquets), and that patients are
accounted for with triage tape appropriately (right arm).
7. Provide frequent progress reports to Command.
8. Coordinate activities with other sectors. (extrication, treatment, transportation)
9. Terminate triage activities and inform Command that personnel are available for
reassignment.

TRIAGE SECTOR

M.P. 203.02

11/24-R

Page 2 of 3

As a general rule, patients should be triaged and tagged with triage tape before being moved
to a treatment area. IMMEDIATE patients are moved first, followed by DELAYED patients.
Dead/Dying patients should be reassessed as more resources become available. If not
breathing after lifesaving interventions, they are considered dead and can be left in place. If
there is an immediate threat to the patients or responders, triage can be performed after the
patients are moved to a safe area. If already triaged, Dead/Dying patients should be left in
place and resources should move more viable patients to a safe location. Dead/Dying patients
should be reassessed once the threat is mitigated, and responders can safely reenter the area.
Depending on the safety of the site and the arrangement of the patients, it may be necessary
to triage patients at the entrance to the treatment area.
In a very large incident, it may be necessary to establish multiple triage locations. Regardless
of where triage is performed, the triage process requires close coordination between the
extrication and treatment sector officers.
Triage Report
Once triage is complete, the Triage Sector Officer then radios Command with a Triage Report.
The Triage Report includes the number of patients, their classification, and any pertinent
information (pediatric/adult, burns, chemical exposure, etc.). For example, a Triage Report at
a multi-vehicle collision may sound like: “Triage to Command. Triage is complete. We have 13

total patients: 6 IMMEDIATES, 4 pediatric and 2 Adults, 3 DELAYED, and 4 MINOR INJURIES.”

After the Triage Report, the TRO will update all responding crews the size of the incident.
Completion of triage is an EMS tactical benchmark and will be tracked by the dispatch center.
Triage provides Command with essential information regarding decisions to call for additional
resources or to scale back the response. Once triage is complete, Command may reassign
triage crews to other functions.

Page 1 of 2

An Extrication Sector is utilized in multiple patient incidents that require physical disentanglement
and/or the removal of trapped victims. Extrication is responsible for removing and delivering
patients to a treatment area. Extrication will assist triage with any patient treatment that is
necessary prior to disentanglement.
Extrication and triage sectors should be assigned separately (see Model Procedures Guide for
Emergency Medical Incidents, National Fire Service Incident Management Systems Consortium,
1996). This clearly distinguishes between two important, though distinct functions. . . identifying
patient number and severity (triage), versus victim disentanglement and removal to a treatment
area (extricaton).
Extrication Sector Responsibilities
The following items represent the standard operations that will normally be performed by the
Extrication Sector:
1. Determine the location, number and condition of all patients (coordinate with Triage).
2. Determine if triage will be performed in place or at the entrance to the treatment area (see “Triage
Sector”).
3. Determine resources.
4. Assign and supervise extrication teams.
5. Extricate and deliver patients to the treatment area(s) or to a casualty collection point.
6. Provide frequent progress reports to Command.
7. Ensure safety and accountability of all patients and assigned personnel.
8. Coordinate activities with other sectors.
9. Notify Command when all patients have been removed and that companies are available for
reassignment.
The Extrication Sector Officer shall wear a sector vest for identification purposes
The Extrication Officer should be positioned in a readily visible location that is accessible to arriving
companies and maintain a view of the scene. Face-to-face communications should be used within
the sector. Company officers should use messengers to relay information to the sector officer. The
sector officer shall provide frequent progress reports to Command.
As a general rule, patients should be triaged and tagged in the impact area. However, depending on the
safety of the site and the arrangement of the patients, there may be instances when triage is performed at
the entrance to the treatment area. Regardless of where triage is performed, the triage process requires
close coordination between triage, extrication and treatment sector officers.
The first priority for removal to the treatment area will be IMMEDIATE patients followed by DELAYED
patients. IMMEDIATE patients should be moved to a treatment area without delay. These patients can
easily be spotted with night-reflective IMMEDIATE labels placed on or near their bodies by the triage
team(s). In some cases of confined entrapment, removing “DELAYED” patients may occur before
access can be gained to “IMMEDIATE” patients. These patients may need to be moved to the
treatment sector ahead of “IMMEDIATE” patients.

Page 2 of 2

All non-ambulatory patients should be moved on backboards, with cervical spine precautions if
indicated. Companies may be assigned as "litter bearers" to assist in this movement. Pick-up trucks,
baggage carts or similar conveyances may also be used. Full spine immobilization may not be possible
during the early stages of an incident.
The Extrication Officer should assign personnel to help size-up the situation. An evaluation of the
number of patients involved and the complexity of extrication requirements is an immediate priority. A
reasonable guideline is an initial commitment of one company per five (5) victims.
This is reasonable for extending initial and immediate care when numerous patients are involved in a
major incident. The goal, as resources and priorities permit, is to provide all resources necessary to
extricate and move patients to the Treatment Sector.
If the patients are spread over a large area, Extrication should assign companies to a specific area or
group of patients. The company officer assigned will determine the immediate needs of those patients
and request assistance if necessary. The Company Officer has responsibility for all those patients until
they are delivered to a treatment area or assigned to another company.
If the incident site involves a large area, it may be necessary to create more then one Extrication
Sector. Responsibility should be divided geographically with appropriate sector designations. (e.g.
“North Extrication). Branch operations may be required to coordinate this effort.
Most ALS personnel should be assigned to the Treatment Sector. However, some paramedics may
also need to be assigned to the Extrication Sector to provide ALS treatment for critical patients
undergoing extended extrication efforts.
When victims require forcible extrication, ladder companies should be assigned. Ladder apparatus
should be brought in close to the scene while other apparatus is parked at a distance to avoid
congestion. If the extrication requires specialized equipment (i.e., wreckers, cranes, cutting torches),
these must be requested through Command.
The Extrication Officer is responsible for assuring the safety of the area where patients are being
extricated. This will require the commitment of personnel with protective lines and extinguishing
equipment where a fire risk exists. If fire is involved, coordination with firefighting sectors will be
required. The safety of patients and Fire Department personnel must be a primary concern.
To reduce confusion and congestion, Triage will initially direct all MINOR (ambulatory) patients using
the S.T.A.R.T. criteria to a specific area. Extrication Sector is later responsible to further assess these
patients once more critical activities have taken place. Extrication may decide to remove these patients
to an "Assembly Area." Green salvage covers can be used to identify this area. A city bus or other
vehicle can be used to transport these people to a suitable location.
As patients are moved from the extrication area, fewer resources may be required. The Extrication
Sector should advise Command when companies or personnel are available for reassignment.

TREATMENT SECTOR

M.P. 203.04

03/00-R

Page 1 of 3

A Treatment Sector is utilized to provide a site to manage the treatment of multiple IMMEDIATE and
DELAYED patients. Treatment Sector is responsible for establishing a treatment area to provide
stabilization and continuing care of patients until they can be transported to a medical facility. The objective
of the treatment sector is to rapidly treat and transport all patients.
Treatment Sector Responsibilities
The following items represent the standard operations that will normally be performed by the Treatment
Sector:
1. Identify whether patient treatment will occur “in place” or in a designated treatment area. Coordinate
with Triage and Extrication Sectors.
2. Determine resources.
3. Identify and establish a large treatment area. If incident is large, establish separate “Immediate” and
“Delayed” treatment areas.
4. Assign and supervise treatment teams.
5. Ensure that all patients have been triaged, assessed and re-triaged as needed.
6. Aggressive treatment and rapid packaging of patients.
7. Provide frequent progress report to Command.
8. Ensure safety and accountability of all patients and assigned personnel.
9. Verify transportation priorities with Transportation Sector.
10. Coordinate with other sectors.
11. Notify Command when all patients have been moved from the treatment area.
The Treatment Sector officer will wear a sector vest for identification purposes.
The Sector officers should determine together with Command whether patients would be treated “in place”
or treated at a specific treatment area.
If treatment will occur “in place,” companies should be directed by the Treatment Sector officer to specific
patient or vehicle (e.g., “E20, you have the patients in the red sedan. R17 will assist.”). The goal will be to
assign one ALS or BLS company and one Rescue to each patient, resources permitting. Crews should
initially focus their effort on treating and transporting IMMEDIATE patients. These patients can easily be
spotted with night-reflective IMMEDIATE labels placed on or near their bodies by the triage team(s).
Treatment teams should communicate with Command to obtain additional Rescues.
If patient treatment will occur in a designated “treatment area”, then the Treatment Sector officer should
establish a treatment area and prepare for the arrival of patients from Extrication. The treatment entry point
should be readily identified (e.g. traffic cones) and have personnel to direct arriving patients. The treatment
area must be in a readily accessible location for patient entry and transportation loading but away from any
dangerous conditions associated with the incident.
The treatment area should be large enough to absorb all patients and the large numbers of treatment
personnel-THINK BIG! This area should be located in a safe area with consideration given to allow for easy
access by rescues or ambulances. If the incident is large enough, Treatment should designate separate
"IMMEDIATE" and "DELAYED" treatment areas.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

TREATMENT SECTOR

M.P. 203.04

03/00-R

Page 2 of 3

The treatment area(s) should have a readily identifiable entrance using traffic cones, signs or other
markers. Red and yellow salvage covers can also be used to identify the IMMEDIATE care and DELAYED
care areas, for IMMEDIATE and DELAYED patients, respectively. One salvage cover provides ample
working room for up to three patients.
If the incident scene is very large, it may be necessary to establish more than one treatment area in
different locations. Branch operations may be required to coordinate these efforts. Geographic
designations (i.e., “East Treatment”, “West Treatment”) should be utilized (“Transportation Branch, Multiple
Site Coordination”).
Treatment shall advise Command when ready to receive patients.
Of all the sectors, the Treatment Sector typically requires the heaviest commitment of personnel. During
major incidents, one company per four (4) patients should be the initial objective (one rescuer per patient).
As resources permit, the overall goal is to provide all the resources necessary to treat all the patients.
Treatment should assign personnel to meet and direct first arriving litter-bearers on the placement of
patients in "IMMEDIATE” and "DELAYED" Areas. Patients in the treatment area should be arranged in an
orderly manner with adequate space provided between patients to allow working room for treatment
personnel. First arriving patients should be placed near the exit point. Rescuers should first fill from exit
towards the entrance as patients are delivered to treatment. This will eliminate personnel from having to
step over or move around patients as they are delivered or transported.
Non-triaged patients arriving at the treatment area must be triaged and tagged at the entrance. A triage
team should be located at the entrance for this purpose. As these new patients are tagged, the Treatment
Sector officer should forward a “Triage Update” to Command to include these newly-discovered patients.
Treatment personnel must continue to assess all patients for changes in conditions, through an ongoing
basis to maintain appropriate triage classifications. Once initial triage activities have been completed, triage
teams can be reassigned to Treatment to continuously re-evaluate patients. ALS treatment will be given
primarily in the "IMMEDIATE" treatment area. Less intensive patient monitoring and treatment will be given
to the "DELAYED" treatment area with mostly BLS personnel assigned to this area. Medical information
(vital signs, injuries, treatment rendered) should be documented on the appropriate side of the triage tag.
A variety of ALS personnel, BLS personnel, medical staff and others may be assigned to the Treatment
Sector. The Treatment Sector officer must have specific assignments for these varied personnel. Non-fire
department medical personnel should be closely supervised by the Treatment Sector officer or others.
Command staff, branch directors and Sector officers will have full supervisory authority over this staff.
If the condition of a patient changes significantly (better or worse) it may be necessary to transfer the
patient to a higher or lower priority area. The Treatment Sector officer should be advised. Once all
IMMEDIATE patients have been treated, DELAYED patients who have significant mechanism of injury
should be reevaluated and upgraded to IMMEDIATE as necessary.

The Treatment Sector must cause aggressive treatment and packaging of patients with an emphasis on
rapid transport. The Treatment Sector officer must maintain an immediate awareness of which patients are
ready for transport. The Sector officer must ensure treatment is rapid, adequate, and appropriate numbers
of treatment personnel are assigned to each patient. The only time extended treatment should be
considered is when immediate transportation is not available. Close coordination with the Transportation
Sector officer must be maintained to ensure rapid transportation.
When transportation is immediately available, transportation of the patient becomes a priority over
extended on-site treatment. Rapid transportation is of the essence.
The Treatment Sector officer will consult with the Transportation Sector on the allocation of patients to
various medical facilities.
The Treatment Sector officer should forward progress reports and triage updates to Command as needed.
The Treatment Sector officer is responsible for determining the need for additional medical supplies at the
scene and should request their delivery through Command. A Medical Supply Sector will automatically
occur on all 3-A-M incidents. This sector should be established near the treatment area (“Medical Supply
Sector”).

A Transportation Sector is established to manage patient transportation from the scene to appropriate
medical facilities. Transportation Sector is responsible for arranging all of the transportation needs for
a multiple-patient incident and for allocating those patients to appropriate medical facilities.
Transportation Sector Responsibilities
The following represent the standards operations that will be performed by the Transportation Sector.
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Determine/request resources.
Determine (with Command) the rescue loading area and helicopter landing zone as needed.
Determine hospital availability status by contacting Dispatch on Med-9.
Coordinate patient allocation and destination with Treatment Sector.
Aggressively supervise the movement of patients from the treatment area to the ambulance loading
area or helicopter landing zone.
6. Maintain an accounting of all patients and patient destinations.
7. Provide progress reports, allocations, ETA’s, to receiving hospitals.
8. Ensure the safety and accountability of all assigned personnel.
9. Provide frequent progress reports to Command.
10. Coordinate activities with other sectors, especially Treatment.
11. Notify hospital (through Dispatch) of estimated arrival time of specific rescues or helicopters.
12. Notify Command when all IMMEDIATE patients have been transported.
13. Notify the hospitals when all patients are transported and operations are terminating.
The Transportation Sector Officer must assume a visible position in the treatment area or patient loading
area and wear a sector vest.
The Transportation Sector Officer must “size up” the transportation needs, including ambulances, air
ambulances or other transportation modes, as well as staffing needs and communicate those needs to
Command. Additional personnel may be needed to assist with medical communications (“Hospital
Communications Coordinator”), transport loading (”Loading Coordinator”), record keeping (“Charting
Officer”), air medical transport coordination (“LZ Sector”) and staging (“Staging”).
Transportation should determine, in concert with Command, the location for staging and aero-medical
(helicopter) transport. If helicopters are used, Transportation should establish a landing zone a safe
distance from the scene, assign at least one Engine Company to the LZ and designate an “LZ Sector.” LZ
Sector will keep track of patient destination, communicate landing instructions with incoming and outgoing
aircraft and enforce established safety standards for landing zones (Brush Fire Air Support.)
It may be necessary to use ambulances or other vehicles to carry patients from the treatment area to the
landing zone. Helicopters should be used to transport critical patients to more distance medical facilities,
allowing closer hospitals to receive patients by ground ambulance.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

TRANSPORTATION SECTOR

M.P. 203.05

Transportation should also determine a suitable location next to Treatment to establish a patient loading
area. Rescues should be staged off site and brought in to the loading area as needed, no more than two at
a time. Transportation must coordinate closely the preparation of patients with Treatment and have
rescues and ambulances immediately ready in the loading area. Transportation should aggressively seeks
patients from Treatment and have two rescues or ambulances in the loading area at all times. These
rescues should have a separate entry and exit point into the loading area to eliminate the need to back
ambulances.
Transportation Sector must ensure that contact with appropriate medical facilities is accomplished as soon
as possible to determine individual hospital capabilities to receive patients. Hospitals should be advised of
the location and type of incident, along with the triage report indicating the number of patients, nature (e.g.,
trauma, burns, medical), and the severity of their injuries. Transportation should initiate medical facility
inventory by contacting the Dispatch Center on Med-9 early during the incident.
Treatment Sector will normally advise Transportation when patients are ready for transport,. Transportation
will allocate patients to medical facilities according to patient injury and priority, hospital capacity and
specialty (pediatric, burns, Level I Trauma,etc.).
Transportation of IMMEDIATE patients will receive priority followed by the transport of DELAYED and
MINOR patients. If needed, transport of MINOR patients to a medical facility may be accomplished by using
city busses or vans. In general, it is preferred to “leap-frog” MINOR patients to distant hospitals to minimize
transport times for DELAYED patients to closer facilities.
Personnel assigned to Transportation will remove patients from the treatment area and deliver them to the
selected rescues or other transport units (vans, buses, etc.). Treatment and Transportation Sectors must
maintain close coordination to determine the most appropriate allocation for each patient.
Prior to transport, the Transportation Sector Officer (or designee) will remove a transportation tracking
slip from each triage tag and write in the transport unit and hospital destination on the slip. These
tracking slips are kept by Transportation to maintain an accounting of all patients leaving the scene.
They can also be verified by Command, who has the initial triage tracking slips.
When rescues or helicopters have left the scene, Transportation should advise the Dispatch Center on
Med-9 of the estimated arrival time and patient status (e.g., “Rescue 9 is enroute to Good Samaritan, ETA
of 5 minutes, with one IMMEDIATE patient.”). The Dispatch Center will relay this information to the
appropriate medical facility.
Rescue personnel will have the responsibility to perform a courtesy notification to the receiving hospital,
indicating their estimated arrival time, the number and type of patients on board, along with a brief
description of their injures. ALS personnel should operate under Standing Orders and not patch for
Medical Direction unless necessary.
When all IMMEDIATE patients have been transported from the scene, Transportation should notify
Command. A declaration by Command to Dispatch of “All IMMEDIATES Transported” is an EMS
tactical benchmark.

Page 1 of 2

In large, complex medical incidents, it may be necessary to coordinate the transport of patients from two or
more treatment areas simultaneously. This may require the creation of a Transportation Branch and the
assignment of a Transportation Branch Director to coordinate transportation functions for all of the
treatment locations.
Transportation Branch has the following responsibilities:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Ensure the functions of transportation are carried out.
Supervise and coordinate the transportation functions and personnel assigned.
Determine/request resource needs to Command.
Communicate direction to tactical units (sectors)
Ensure units are completing objectives.
Maintain incident documentation.

The following represents the standard operations that will be performed by the Transportation Branch:
1. Coordinate the assignment of rescues from Staging area to various sectors (e.g., East Transportation,
West transportation, LZ).
2. Determine hospital availaiblity status through Dispatch on Med-9.
3. Coordinate all patient allocation and hospital destination.
4. Coordinate the movement of patients from treatment areas to Rescue loading areas or helicopter
landing zone.
5. Maintain an accounting of all patients and patient destinations.
6. Ensure the safety and accountability of all assigned personnel.
7. Provide frequent progress reports to Command.
8. Notify hospital (through Dispatch) of estimated arrival time of specific rescues or helicopters.
9. Notify Command when all IMMEDIATE patients have been transported.
The Transportation Branch Director will be stationed at a central location, preferably at or close to the
Command Post. Transportation Sector personnel will be assigned to each treatment area as well as at
Staging and at the Helicopter Landing Zone. The Transportation Branch Director will coordinate all of these
assignments and assign the necessary resources. Each Sector (e.g., “East Transportation Sector”,” West
Transportation Sector,” “Staging,” “LZ”) will require at least one full company.
Due to the complexity of this operation, a separate radio channel should be assigned exclusively to the
Transportation Branch. This will facilitate the amount of communications necessary between the Branch
Director and the assigned Sector officers at each location. The Transportation Branch Director will handle
all communications with Dispatch (on Med. 9 or any other channel assigned by Dispatch).
The Transportation Sector personnel in each location will communicate their transportation needs directly
to the Transportation Branch Director to obtain resources. The Transportation Branch Director will then
direct Staging to assign one or more rescues to a specific loading area.
When a rescue or ambulance is ready for loading, the Sector officer should advise Transportation Branch
of the number of patients being loading into a rescue and their severity. The Branch Director will then
advise the Transportation Sector officer of the destination hospital. This Sector officer will advise the
rescue personnel of their hospital destination. The Transportation Branch will advise receiving hospitals of
patients enroute, their triage status, and provide an ETA.

Each Transportation Sector officer will also remove a transportation tracking slip from the triage tag of each
patient and write in the transport unit and hospital destination. Other information (name, age, injuries) can
be completed on the tracking slip as time permits. These tracking slips are kept by Transportation Sector
officers to maintain an accounting of all patients leaving the Sector. They can also be verified by
Command, who has the initial triage tracking slips.
The Transportation Branch Director will assign necessary resources to the Helicopter Landing Zone to
move patients from the treatment areas over to LZ. This may require the use of a rescue. Helicopters
should be used to transport IMMEDIATE patients to more distant appropriate medical facilities.
The Transportation Sector personnel assigned to each Treatment Area will perform the same function as
established for an incident with a single treatment area. The Transportation Sector officer functions as a
coordinator and resource allocator, consolidating communications with Dispatch and Command.

Page 1 of 1

Medical Supply Sector
Major incidents rapidly consume standard complements of medical supplies carried by fire companies.
Since, large multi-casualty incidents (MCIs) require a significant amount of EMS supplies and generate
large quantities of biohazard waste, additional supplies must be obtained and delivered to the site.
To improve the fire department’s capability to treat patients arising from a large-scale multiple patient
incident, a Medical Supply Sector shall be established during all 3-Alarm Medical (or greater) major medical
incidents using a minimum of one fire company. Additionally, Dispatch will special call Medical Support 19
from the airport and an EMS supply truck from Resource Management to the scene.
The Medical Supply Sector will be staffed with members from the assigned fire company, the personnel
assigned to MS19, and the EMS supply truck, with the company officer assigned as as the Medical Supply
Sector Officer. A second EMS supply truck and a second adaptive response unit will be dispatched to the
scene following an upgrade to a 4-Alarm Medical incident.
The Medical Supply Sector should be established in close proximity to the treatment area. At expanded
incidents, the Medical Supply Sector may be assigned to the Logistics Section.
At incidents with less than 20 patients, Medical Supply Sector will report to Command. At larger mass
casualty incidents, this Sector will report to Medical Branch or Logistics Section.
Capabilities
The Medical Supply Sector will provide the following to other sectors as needed:
•
•
•
•
•

Provide EMS supplies (triage tags, IVs, backboards, trauma supplies, gloves, goggles, masks, etc.).
Provide biohazard supplies (biohazard trash containers, biohazard plastic bags, sharps containers,

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

M.P. 204.01

This plan provides a basic philosophy and strategic plan for hazardous materials situations. All
Phoenix Fire Department Standard Operating Procedures, unless superseded by a specific part of
this plan, remain in effect for Hazardous Materials incidents.
Hazardous Materials incidents encompass a wide variety of potential situations including fires,
spills, transportation accidents, chemical reactions, explosions and similar events. Hazards
involved may include toxicity, flammability, radiological exposure, corrosives, explosives, health,
and chemical reactions or a combination of factors. This plan provides a general framework for
handling a hazardous materials incident, but does not address the specific tactics or control
measures for particular incidents.

Every incident presents the potential for exposure to hazardous materials; even the products of
combustion of an ordinary fire may present severe hazards to personnel safety.
This procedure is specifically applicable to known hazardous materials incidents, but it does not
reduce the need for appropriate safety precautions at every incident. The use of FULL
PROTECTIVE CLOTHING AND SCBA AS WELL AS SPECIAL PROTECTIVE CLOTHING and the use
of all Standard Operating Procedures on a continuing basis are foundational for this plan.
Dispatch
The Dispatch Center will attempt to obtain any and all information from the person reporting a
hazardous materials incident. The information should, if possible, include material name and/or
type, amount and size of container(s), problem (leak, spill, fire, etc.) and dangerous properties of
the materials AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF PERSONS INJURED OR EXPOSED. The incident
taker should remain on the telephone with the caller to gain additional information after entering
the call for dispatch.
Any additional information shall be relayed to responding units after dispatch. THIS SHOULD
INCLUDE THE SAFEST APPROACH OR BEST ACCESS TO THE INCIDENT IF AVAILABLE.
If the call comes from a person with particular knowledge of the hazardous situation, that person
SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO meet and direct the arriving units. Dispatch shall relay that
person's location and level of knowledge to responding units.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Page 2 of 6

The Dispatch Center will dispatch the APPROPRIATE Hazardous Materials Assignment
COMPANIES to all reported hazardous materials incidents.
Dispatch will inform units as to the prevailing wind speed and direction from the monitoring
station NEAREST THE INCIDENT and advise responding units.
FIRST ARRIVING UNIT
The first arriving officer will establish Command and begin a size-up. The first unit must
consciously avoid committing itself to a dangerous situation. When approaching, slow down or
stop to assess any visible activity taking place. Evaluate effects of wind, topography and location
of the situation. Route any other responding companies away from any hazards.
Command should consider ESTABLISHING LEVEL II STAGING WHENEVER POSSIBLE FOR OTHER
RESPONDING UNITS. STAGED COMPANIES MUST BE in a safe location, taking into account
wind, spill flow, explosion potential and similar factors in any situation. THE DOT GUIDEBOOK,
NFPA REFERENCE MATERIALS, the NIOSH POCKET GUIDE, OR ANY OTHER MATERIAL SUCH
AS MSDS OR SHIPPING PAPERS AVAILABLE TO THEM SHOULD BE USED TO ESTABLISH A
SAFE DISTANCE FOR STAGING.
SIZE-UP
Command must make a careful size-up before making a commitment. It may be necessary to take
immediate action to make a rescue or evacuate an area. This should be attempted only after a
risk/benefit analysis is completed. Personnel must take advantage of available personal protective
equipment in these situations.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

M.P. 204.01

04/98-R

Page 3 of 6

The objective of the size-up is to identify the nature and severity of the immediate problem and to
gather sufficient information to formulate a valid action plan. Hazardous materials incidents
require a cautious and deliberate size-up.
Avoid premature commitment of companies and personnel to potentially hazardous locations.
Proceed with caution in evaluating risks before formulating a plan and keep uncommitted
companies at a safe distance. IN MANY CASES, EVALUATION BY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
TEAM MEMBERS BEFORE COMMITTING IS THE SAFEST APPROACH.

Identify a hazardous area based on potential danger, taking into account materials involved, time
of day, wind and weather conditions, location of the incident and degree of risk to unprotected
personnel. Take immediate action to evacuate and/or rescue persons in critical danger, if
possible, providing for safety of rescuers FIRST.
The primary objective is to identify the type of materials involved in a situation, and the hazards
presented, before formulating a plan of action. Look for labels, markers, DOT IDENTIFICATION
NUMBERS, NFPA DIAMOND or shipping papers, etc. Refer to pre-fire plans, and ask personnel at
the scene for additional information (plant management, responsible party, truck drivers, fire
department specialist). Use reference materials carried on apparatus and have Dispatch contact
other sources for assistance in sizing up the problem (state agencies, fire department specialists,
manufacturers of materials, etc.).

ACTION PLAN
Based on the initial size-up and any information available, Command will formulate an action plan
to deal with the situation.
THE ACTION PLAN MUST PROVIDE FOR:

1. Safety of all fire personnel
2. Evacuation of endangered area, if necessary
3. Control of situation
4. Stabilization of hazardous materials, and/or
5. Disposal or removal of hazardous material
Most hazardous materials are intended to be maintained in a safe condition for handling and use
through confinement in a container or protective system. The emergency is usually related to the
material escaping from the protective container or system and creating a hazard on the exterior.
The strategic plan must include a method to control the flow or release, get the hazardous
material back into a safe container, neutralize it, allow it to dissipate safely, or coordinate proper
disposal.
The specific action plan must identify the method of hazard control and identify the resources
necessary to accomplish this goal. It may be necessary to select one method over another due to
the unavailability of a particular resource or to adopt a "holding action" to wait for needed
equipment or supplies.
Avoid committing personnel and equipment prematurely or "experimenting" with techniques and
tactics. Many times it is necessary to evacuate and wait for special equipment or TECHNICAL
help.
As a general policy, the Hazardous Materials Team will respond to any situation where a private
contractor is required to clean-up hazardous materials.
CONTROL OF HAZARDOUS AREA
A hazardous material incident has two initial zones associated with the scene, similar to a fire.
There are the LIMITED ACCESS ZONE and the EVACUATION ZONE.

PHOENIX REGIONAL

LIMITED ACCESS ZONE (LAZ)
The LAZ is the area in which personnel are potentially in immediate danger from the hazardous
condition. This is established by Command and controlled by the Fire Department. Access to this
area will be rigidly controlled and only personnel with proper protective equipment and an
assigned activity will enter. All companies will remain in tact in designated staging areas until
assigned. Personnel will be assigned to monitor entry and exit of all personnel from the LAZ. The
LAZ should be geographically described to all responding units, if possible and identified by yellow
fireline tape. (A Lobby Control Sector will be established to control access to the LAZ and
maintain an awareness of which personnel are working in the area.)

Establish a safe perimeter around hazardous area and identify with Hazard Zone tape.

•

Request adequate assistance to maintain the perimeter.

•

Identify an entrance/exit point and inform Command of its location.

•

Coordinate with Haz Sector to identify required level of protection for personnel operating in
the Hazard Zone.

•

Collect/return accountability PASSPORTS of all companies entering/leaving the controlled area.

Restriction of personnel access into the LAZ includes not only Fire Department personnel, but any
others who may wish to enter the L. A. Zone (Police, press, employees, tow truck drivers,
ambulance personnel, etc.). Command is responsible for everyone's safety.
EVACUATION ZONE (EZ)
The EZ is the larger area surrounding the LAZ in which a lesser degree of risk to personnel exists.
All civilians would be removed from this area. The limits of this zone will be enforced by the
Police Department based on distances and directions established in consultation with Command.
The area to be evacuated depends on the nature and amount of the material and type of risk it
presents to unprotected personnel (toxic, explosive, etc.).
In some cases, it is necessary to completely evacuate a radius around a site for a certain distance
(i.e., potential explosion).
In other cases, it may be advisable to evacuate a path downwind where toxic or flammable
vapors may be carried (and control ignition sources in case of flammable vapors).
Reference: Evacuation Sector, Police Liaison Sector)
NOTE:

When toxic or irritant vapors are being carried downwind, it may be most effective to,
(shelter in place), keep everyone indoors with windows and doors closed to prevent
contact with the material instead of evacuating the area. In these cases, companies will
be assigned to patrol the area assisting citizens in shutting down ventilation systems
and evacuating persons with susceptibility to respiratory problems.

In all cases, the responsibility for safety of all potentially endangered citizens rests with
Command. Once the Hazardous Materials Sector has been established, Haz Mat personnel will
define and establish a hot, warm and cold zone. These zones will remain in effect for the
remainder of the incident.
USE OF NON-FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL
In some cases, it may be advantageous to use non-Fire Department personnel to evaluate hazards
and perform certain functions within their area of expertise.
When such personnel are outfitted with breathing apparatus, chemical suits, etc., they must be
made aware of the functions, limitations and safety precautions necessary in their use. Fire
Department personnel with the necessary protective equipment must closely monitor and/or
accompany such personnel for safety.

An incident involving hazardous materials has a higher probability of causing an evacuation of an
affected area than any other incident. By the very nature of the hazard, this type of evacuation often
provides very little preparation time. Decisions will need to be made quickly, and citizens moved
rapidly.
This procedure identified the method and resources required to execute a small to large scale
evacuation.
Levels of Evacuation
Experience has reflected three levels of evacuation. Each requires a different resource commitment.
They include: Site Evacuation, Intermediate Level Evacuation, and Large Scale Evacuation
Site Evacuation
Site evacuation involves a small number of citizens. This typically includes the workers at the site, and
persons from adjacent occupancies or areas. The citizens are easily evacuated and collected upwind
at the perimeter area. Evacuation holding times are typically short, generally less than an hour or two,
and citizens are permitted to return to their businesses or homes.
Intermediate Level Evacuation
The next level, or intermediate level, involves larger numbers of citizens and/or affects a larger area.
This level affects off-site homes and businesses and normally affects fewer than 100 persons. Persons
may remain out of the area for two to four hours or more. Evacuation completion times will be
somewhat longer, but generally rapid. Collecting, documenting, and controlling the evacuees becomes
more difficult. Off-site collection sites or shelter areas will need to be determined and managed. Some
evacuees will leave the area on their own or be sent home by employers. Site perimeters become
larger and perimeter security requires more resource. Close coordination with the Police Department
and other agencies will be required.
Large Scale Evacuation
A large or concentrated release of a hazardous substance may cause a large off-site evacuation.
Thousands of citizens could be evacuated. Rapid initiation of the evacuation process may be required.
Evacuees may be out of their homes and businesses for many hours if not days. Evacuation
completion time frames will be extended. Evacuation shelters will need to be located, opened and
managed. Documentation and tracking of evacuees becomes more important as well as more difficult
to manage. Very close coordination with the police and multiple agencies will be required. Site and
evacuation perimeters become extended and require much more resources to maintain. Security of the
evacuated area becomes a concern. In most cases, the City's Emergency Operations Center (EOC)
will be opened to support the evacuation and site operations.

Time Factor Considerations
Time factors are also an important consideration in the evacuation decision.
A rapidly developing moving toxic cloud will demand a more immediate size-up and quick decision
making. Such forced speed of decision making often is made with less information than a slow moving
event. Accuracy of information will also be limited.
The speed of the developing hazard will dictate the speed of evacuation. Immediate evacuation will
require more resources than a slower developing event.
It will take time to complete the evacuation. The more people to be evacuated, and the distance
between the occupancies to be evacuated, the more time required. The greater numbers needing
evacuation will also require a greater resource commitment.
Decision to Evacuate
The decision to evacuate needs to be considered quickly and early. Delays in initiating evacuations
can expose greater numbers of the public to the hazardous product. An unnecessary evacuation
should be avoided. However, once the hazard has been identified and verified, the process of deciding
who, when, and how to evacuate should proceed quickly.
In some cases, in-place sheltering (staying indoors) may provide adequate protection and should be a
serious consideration in the decision making process.
Factors to consider when evaluating the evacuation need include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Product Toxicity (as a health hazard)
Concentrations (before it becomes a health hazard)

In some situations, in-place sheltering can be used to protect the public rather than to initiate an
evacuation. In-place sheltering can be considered during the following circumstances:
•
•
•
•
•

The hazardous material has been identified as having a low or moderate level health risk.
The material has been released from its container and is now dissipating.
Leaks can be controlled rapidly and before evacuation can be completed.
Exposure to the product is expected to be short-term and of low health risk.
The public can be adequately protected by staying indoors.

Command may need to provide instructions to the affected public regarding the need to stay indoors
and in such protective measures as shutting down their evaporative cooling systems, and sealing their
buildings.
Command Organization
Once Command has determined evacuation to be necessary, adequate resources need to be called to
the scene and appropriate agencies notified to respond. A central staging area for all agencies should
be considered.
The Incident Command Organization will need to be expanded to include other Sections/Branches.
This level of Command structure may need to be implemented to more effectively manage a large scale
incident. Sections/Branches to be considered include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•

Notify the news media and provide status reports and updates as necessary.
Provide the media with consistent and accurate evacuation instructions as provided by
Command or the Evacuation Branch/Sector.
Utilize the media and coordinate evacuation notices through news media.

Red Cross Responsibilities
Once long term sheltering is identified, the Red Cross will open and manage shelters. Early notification
is required. The Red Cross will need up to three hours to get adequate personnel, equipment and
supplies to the shelter sites.
Some Fire Department resources may need to be committed to the shelters, particularly in the area of
initial opening and staffing by a shelter crew, and later for potential emergency medical support.
Evacuation Branch/Sector Responsibilities
An Evacuation Branch/Sector must be established. On large-scale evacuations, Evacuation Branch
should have a separate radio channel. Various sub-level sectors would also need to be established
and report to Evacuation Branch.
Typically a large commitment of police officers will be required to accomplish an evacuation. The
Evacuation Branch officer must obtain a ranking police officer at his/her location in order to closely
coordinate evacuation efforts. An appropriate commitment of police resource must be obtained.
Evacuation responsibilities include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Provide sectors with shelter location and instructions.
Provide sectors with evacuation instruction pads.
Provide sectors with private vehicle routing instructions (out of the area).
Obtain/provide buses or other transportation to those requiring transportation out of the area.
(For large scale evacuation, start with two buses and request more as needed.)
Evacuate those at greatest risk first.
Evacuate the greatest concentrated areas next (i.e., apartment complex).
Consider individual sectors for large population occupancies (i.e., multi-story buildings, large
apartment complexes, schools, etc.).
As individual geographic or grid sectors complete their evacuations, terminate the sector identity
and reassign resources to other developing sectors (for large scale evacuation).
Closely document and maintain records of the evacuation process to avoid duplication or
missed areas.

On-Site Notification to Evacuate
Door-to-door notification is time-consuming. In many cases, adequate resources and time is not
available to do this type of face-to-face notification. Use of sirens, air horns and PA systems will speed
the alert process.
When making door-to-door evacuations:
• Be in uniform.
• Wear your helmet.
Face-to-face notification should include the following instructions:
• There's been a hazardous materials incident.
• You are in danger.
• Leave immediately.
• Go to the shelter (location).

transportation?
•
• Provide the customer with evacuation instructions.
Take the following items:
• Wallet/purse
• House & car keys
• Money
• Eye glasses
• Medications
• Proper clothing
• Pets
In other situations, where immediate and rapid evacuation makes door-to-door notification impossible,
use the following notification method:
• Use 3 five-second blasts of the siren while on the "YELP" setting.
• Followed by the standard evacuation instruction over PA system (see instructions above)
• Use maximum volume on PA system.
• Proceed slowly to maximize notification.
• Initiate notification at the beginning of each block and each 50 yards after that.
Once each assigned grid of objectives is complete, report completion to the Evacuation Branch/Sector
officer.
Refusal to Leave
Some citizens may refuse to leave. A few methods of persuasion to leave include:
• Be in uniform.
• Wear your helmet.
• Wear SCBA and facepiece (air hose may not need to be connected) when advising the citizen
to leave.

Ask for next of kin and a phone number.
Write the next of kin information down.

Evacuations follow somewhat of a triage philosophy--we'll evacuate the greatest number for the
greatest benefit. Individual refusals will be left to fend for themselves. There simply may not be
enough time or resources to initiate forced removal of persons from their homes. However,
documentation of the refusal should be done. Write the address down (or if radio traffic permits, radio
the address to the Evacuation Branch/Sector officer).
Transportation Sector Responsibilities
A Transportation Branch/Sector should be a priority consideration for any intermediate
or large-scale evacuation. Not all citizens will have a vehicle available to them.
• Obtain buses (start with minimum of two) and other vehicles that can be used for transportation.
• Stage all transportation resources.
• Put one firefighter (or police officer) with a radio on each vehicle equipped with a Fire or Police
Department radio.
• Coordinate with Evacuation Branch/Sector the pick-up points or addresses of those citizens
needing transportation.
On-Duty Deputy
Any time more than ten (10) persons are evacuated, the Duty Deputy advises the City Manager, or
his/her designee, of the situation.
If the Duty Deputy cannot respond to the incident or is delayed, the Duty Deputy will need to contact the
incident command staff for a status report. Command should be prepared to respond to this request
via cellular telephone, etc.
Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Operations
If a significant or major evacuation occurs, the City's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) will go into
operation. The EOC will collect department heads and senior staff from the Fire,
Police, City Manager's Office, Public Works, and other City departments to the EOC. The EOC's
objective is to use the City's resources to support the incident operations and evacuations.
Command should be prepared for this support and potential policy direction in regards to the incident
and evacuation operations.
If the EOC is in operation, Command must assign an EOC liaison as part of the Command
Organization. The EOC Liaison must have a radio communications link (another radio channel) with
the EOC and a cellular telephone link. If the EOC has a CAD Terminal, the EOC liaison will need
access to an MDT. (The MDT and cellular phones are available in any Battalion vehicle and some staff
vehicles.)

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS EVACUATION

Responsibilities of the EOC Liaison Officer are:
• Obtain a radio communications link with the EOC (through Dispatch Center on a separate
channel).
• Obtain a cellular telephone or other communication link with the EOC.
• Obtain an immediate status report from Command and provide that report to the EOC fire
officer.
• Provide an immediate report to the EOC on any changes in plans, strategy, problems
encountered, etc.
• Provide progress reports every 30 minutes unless the EOC requires more frequent or less
frequent reports.
• Act as the communication link from EOC to Command.
• Provide Command with direction, policy information, etc. that is communicated from the EOC.
The EOC will remain in operation for the duration of the evacuation. Command will maintain an EOC
liaison and a communication link with the EOC throughout the evacuation, including de-commitment
and return of evacuees.
Return Evacuees
The decision to return evacuees to their homes will be the sole responsibility of the Fire Department
Incident Commander. If the EOC is operating, the decision to return evacuees will be made by the
EOC staff. No other City agency will be authorized to order the return.
Returning evacuees may require transportation. A Transportation Branch/Sector may need to be
reactivated to provide for these needs.

Hazardous Materials Decontamination
M.P. 204.01B

04/18

Page 1 of 5

Purpose
The purpose of the Decontamination Procedure is to assure that any potentially harmful or
dangerous residues on persons, equipment or apparatus are confined within the Hot Zone.
Decontamination is intended to prevent the spread of contaminants beyond the already
contaminated area, including the fire station, the hospital, and other environments.
Procedure
The specific measures required to decontaminate personnel, equipment, or apparatus will vary
with the contaminant, the circumstances and the level of contamination. These factors must be
considered on a case‐by‐case basis, within the guidelines described in this procedure.

Command is responsible for assuring that a Decontamination Sector is implemented at
incidents which involve a potential contamination problem. This sector should be assigned to
personnel from the Hazardous Materials Team. Decontamination must be integrated into the
management plan of the hazardous materials incident.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Hazardous Materials Decontamination
M.P. 204.01B

04/18

Page 2 of 5

The Decontamination Sector Officer is responsible for determining the most appropriate
decontamination procedures and managing the decontamination process. This should be done
in conjunction with advice from the Poison Control Center.
The initial assessment of decontamination requirements must be based upon the specific needs
of the situation. The decontamination process must be appropriately designed for the specific
materials involved and the degree and type of exposure encountered. The assessment will
require research and may involve consultation with toxicology resources.
The Decontamination Sector Officer must assume that all personnel and equipment preparing
to leave the Hot Zone are contaminated. Three courses of action are available:
1. Confirm not contaminated by using instruments or investigation based on the nature of
the situation.
2. Decontaminate (as appropriate to the situation) and release.
3. Retain and package items for removal from the site for disposal or decontamination at a
different location.
In all cases, the primary objective must be to avoid contaminating anyone or anything beyond
the Hot Zone. When in doubt about contamination, decontaminate all affected personnel,
equipment, and apparatus.
The Decontamination Area should be established within the Hot Zone perimeter adjacent to
the Entrance/Exit (Lobby Control). Personnel, equipment and apparatus shall not be permitted
to leave the Hot Zone without approval from the Decontamination Sector Officer.
The Decontamination Area should provide a corridor leading away from the source of
contamination toward the Exit, with stations along the way for the deposit of tools, equipment,
protective clothing and other items. Monitoring personnel and equipment should be
appropriately placed along the path. A person travelling along the path should experience a
decreasing level of contamination along the way. When showers or spray nozzles are used,
adequate space must be provided to avoid contamination of other areas or persons.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Hazardous Materials Decontamination
M.P. 204.01B

04/18

Page 3 of 5

All contaminated items must remain within the perimeter of the Hazard Zone until
decontaminated or safely packaged for removal. The Hazard Sector Officer or Decontamination
Sector Officer will be responsible for supervising proper removal of these items. Personnel
should be assigned to inspect persons and/or equipment before being released from the
Decontamination Area. This inspection may be visual or may involve the use of monitoring
instruments, when appropriate. It must be assumed that items or persons are contaminated
unless their non‐contamination can be confirmed.
Decontamination Area Precautions
During the decontamination process, all personnel working in the Decontamination Area must
be adequately protected from contaminants. The Decontamination Sector Officer will identify
and require the appropriate protective equipment. These individuals and their equipment may
also require decontamination after use.
Any run‐off or residue from decontamination procedures must be contained within the Hot
Zone and retained for proper disposal. Contaminated run‐off must not be allowed to spread or
escape. Diking may be necessary and should be directed back to the Hot Zone.
Contaminated Patients
Patients in need of medical treatment should be removed from the source of contamination as
quickly as possible but remain within the Hot Zone perimeter. These patients must not be
allowed to contaminate further areas or persons. It may be necessary to bring treatment
personnel (with adequate protective clothing) into the Hot Zone to deal with these patients
unless they can be rapidly and effectively decontaminated. After decontamination, the patients
and treatment personnel may leave the Hot Zone.

Transportation
Transporting of Level I patients should not be delayed for complete decontamination. Patients
should be quickly treated for life threatening injuries simultaneously with decontamination
efforts. Once treatment is completed and the patient is ready for transport, the patient should
be covered and transported. The rescue should be brought to the Warm Zone perimeter for
loading. When feasible, the rescue should be prepared by draping exposed surfaces with sheets
or polyurethane covers. Patients should be wrapped or covered to lessen off‐gassing of the
products within the rescue. Rescue and treatment personnel may still have to wear protective
garments and S.C.B.A. while enroute.
If it is necessary to transport contaminated patients to medical facilities, the receiving hospital
must be notified in advance of the nature of the contamination, in order to make necessary
preparations. The rescue used will be considered contaminated and must be decontaminated
before being used to transport any non‐contaminated persons. Helicopters will not be used for
transporting any contaminated patients due to off‐gassing effects on the pilot and flight crew.
Decontaminated Persons
When persons are decontaminated at a Decontamination Area, they may be released to leave
the Hazard Zone. This includes Fire Department personnel, other emergency personnel,
civilians and patients. The Decontamination Sector Officer will determine when it is appropriate
to release custody of protective clothing, personal effects and equipment, after consulting
appropriate medical personnel (i.e., health center physician or Poison Control Center
physician). The Decontamination Sector Officer may release individuals who are substantially
decontaminated and direct them to medical facilities for further evaluation or
decontamination. Individuals may also be directed to shower, change clothes or take other
secondary decontamination measures.
These personnel should complete an exposure form. The health center's exposure control
officer will initiate contact and follow‐up measures.
Protective Equipment and Personal Effects
When feasible, protective clothing and personal effects should be decontaminated and
released from the Hot Zone with the individual. If the Decontamination Sector Officer
determines this is not feasible, these items will be impounded in the Decontamination Area.
Personal effects will be carefully guarded by Decontamination Sector personnel until a
determination can be made regarding their final disposition.

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
M.P. 204.01C

04/98-R

Page 1 of 2

GENERAL FACTORS TO CONSIDER
Due to the wide variety of situations Fire Department personnel may encounter in dealing with
hazardous materials, these considerations will not attempt to provide specific guidelines on any one
individual chemical or situation and are not listed in any priority.
It is important that the first arriving Fire Department company make every effort to determine what
hazardous material(s) is involved, and the amount prior to taking action to stabilize the incident.
Call for additional resources EARLY. The actions taken by command in the first few minutes of an
incident affects the outcome more than any other single factor. Hazardous Materials teams will be
needed as well as a number of other fire companies to support site operations.
Make a slow, cautious approach to the incident. Entering the scene to make positive identification may
be a considerable risk. The danger of explosion, leaking gas and poisoning may be great.
Furthermore, any "Knee-jerk" action taken prior to determining the product involved may place
firefighters at considerable safety risk and may further compound the problem.
Transportation emergencies are often more difficult than those at fixed locations. The materials
involved may be unknown, warning signs may not be visible or obscured by smoke and debris, the
driver may be killed or missing. D.O.T. hazardous materials marking systems are inadequate because
some hazardous materials in quantities up to 1,000 lbs., do not require a placard and there may be
combinations of products involved with only a "dangerous" label showing. Sometimes only the most
evident hazard is identified, while additional hazards are not labelled.
The following items should be considered at any Hazardous Materials incident. (Not all will be
significant at any particular incident.)
1. Cooling Containers--Flame Impingement
a. Obtain adequate water supply, use large GPM hose streams or stang guns.
b. Apply heavy streams to the vapor space area above the tanks liquid line.
c. Use unmanned streams.
d. Use natural barriers to protect personnel.
2. Remove Uninvolved Materials
a. These actions should only be done after a complete site safety plan has been
established by Command and H.I.R.T. Officers.
b. Move individual containers.
c. Move tank cars away from flame.
d. Cool containers before moving.
3. Stop the Leak
a. Use water spray to approach leak.
b. Close valves when safe to do so.
c. Do not apply water to chlorine containers - it will make the leak worse.

4. Apply Diluting Spray or Neutralizing Agent
a. Dilute water-soluble liquids, such as ammonia, chlorine, LPG (No water on CL2
tanks).
b. Use water with caution on some materials.
5. Construct Dams, Dikes or Channels
a. Direct running liquid away from exposures.
b. Control run off from corrosive or toxic materials.
c. Use sand or dirt.
d. Keep product out of sewer, storm systems, canals, or other waterways, etc.
6. Remove Ignition Sources
a. Start down wind.
b. Eliminate all sources of heat, spark, friction.
c. These actions may need to be accomplished in conjunction with the proper
technical advice.
Dispatch has a Reference List of personnel and organizations which may be helpful during a
Hazardous Materials Emergency.
These include:
1. Fire Department personnel with particular experience or knowledge.
2. Authorities in charge of landfills and dumps where Hazardous Materials may be
disposed.
3. Commercial Chemical experts with experience in handling and disposing of most
common chemicals.
4. Pesticide consultants and disposal teams with equipment to clean-up agricultural
chemical spills.
5. Personnel from State and Federal Regulatory Agencies. These personnel should be
contacted for incidents involving transportation of Hazardous Materials.
6. Railroad information numbers.
7. Tank Truck Companies with defueling capability (in case carrier involved in incident has
none).
8. Radioactivity and Military Weapons emergency contacts.

MERCURY RELEASES

M.P. 204.02

07/94-R

Page 1 of 4

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish and document guidelines to be used by the Phoenix Fire
Department when a mercury release occurs at a commercial facility or in a residential setting, including
the interior of apartments.
FACTS ABOUT MERCURY
There are three types of mercury; the two most common types are elemental and inorganic mercury.
Elemental Mercury (Hgo): The most common sources of elemental mercury are blood pressure cuffs,
oral and rectal thermometers, and in laboratories. Elemental mercury could also be found in the same
processes where inorganic mercury may be used (see below).
Symptoms of initial toxic exposure to elemental mercury include fever, chills, dyspnea, and headache
within several hours. Emergency care is supportive with transport to a hospital.
Inorganic Mercury (HG+, HG++): The most common sources of inorganic mercury are scientific
instruments, electrical equipment, felt making, and the manufacturing of caustic soda and disc batteries
(watches).
Acute effects include, but are not limited to, burning mouth, sore throat, nausea and vomiting with
severe gingivitis. Emergency care is supportive with transport to a hospital.
The third type of mercury and the least common is:
Organic Mercury (CH3Hg): The most common sources or organic mercury are in mining, smelting, or
refining operations.
Symptoms include, but are not limited to, hearing defects and loss of concentration.
MERCURY RELEASE AT COMMERCIAL FACILITY
Initial Action Required by Fire Department
1. Upon the arrival of Fire Department units, Command shall:
A. Contact the on-site responsible party;
B. Determine the amount of mercury released;
C. Determine the mercury source and, if possible, secure the source to prevent further mercury
loss.
D. Determine the size of affected area;

B. ISOLATE the affected area utilizing hazard line tape;
C. DENY ENTRY.
D. Request, through Dispatch, that the Fire Prevention Haz Mat specialist and the on-duty Special
Operations personnel respond.
FIRE PERSONNEL
To reduce the possibility of contamination to Fire Department personnel, FIRE DEPARTMENT
MEMBERS:
A. SHALL NOT ENTER THE REPORTED SPILL AREA, UNLESS FOR RESCUE OR
TREATMENT.
Shoes, carpet, etc., are easily contaminated. Not entering the reported spill area will reduce
the potential spreading of the mercury.
B. SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO CLEAN UP EVEN THE SMALLEST AMOUNT OF MERCURY
RELEASED OR ANY OTHER HAZARDOUS MATERIALS RELEASE.
C. SHALL NOT TAKE POSSESSION OF THE MERCURY.
EXCEPTION:
1. When a resident brings mercury to the fire station, personnel may take possession of the
mercury.
2. Fire Department members shall not take possession of mercury generated from a
commercial business.
D. SHALL NOT TRANSPORT ANY QUANTITY OF MERCURY, OR ANY OTHER HAZARDOUS
MATERIALS.
FIRE PREVENTION AND SPECIAL OPERATIONS RESPONSIBILITIES
Fire Prevention may, depending upon each situation:
1. Respond to the incident location to document the requirement for a contractor with the appropriate
equipment to clean up the spilled Mercury and to verify that the requirement is complied with.
2. Shall advise the responsible party of the contractors who have the appropriate equipment and shall
remain on-scene until the contractor responds to the site.
3. Make or verify that all appropriate notifications are made.
On-duty Special Operations Personnel may, depending upon each situation:
1. Respond to the incident location to verify for the Incident Commander that all safety procedures are
employed.

2. Assists the Incident Commander by verifying that the Fire Department's decontamination
procedures are initiated and followed.
3. Make or verify that all appropriate notifications are made and notify the Incident Commander when
completed.
RESPONSIBLE PARTY
The responsible party shall:
A. When required, contact and employ a contractor who has the appropriate equipment to cleanup
and transport the mercury for proper disposal. The Fire Department shall not make the contact
for the responsible party because the Fire Department does not want to incur the costs
associated with the response or cleanup by a contractor.
B. Determine the names of persons who are known or suspected to be contaminated by mercury.
C. Make any other contacts deemed appropriate for the particular situation.
KNOWN/SUSPECTED CONTAMINATED PERSONS
Until proven otherwise through appropriate meter readings, Command shall isolate persons who are
suspected to be contaminated.
Based on the contractor's meter readings, the contractor may require:
A. Decontamination; or
B. Clean clothing be provided for the known/suspected contaminated persons.
KNOWN/SUSPECTED CONTAMINATED CLOTHING, SHOES, MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS
Based on test results, the contractor, not the Fire Department, shall determine when removal of
contaminated items and confiscation of contaminated items may be necessary.
In the event clothing, shoes, jewelry or miscellaneous items, are removed from a person, place the
items in a plastic bag, tie off, and place a name tag on the bag identifying the owner's name. DO NOT
USE BIOHAZARD BAGS BECAUSE THE CONTRACTORS CANNOT ACCEPT IT; THERE ARE
DIFFERENT FEDERALLY MANDATED DISPOSAL REQUIREMENTS THAT MUST BE COMPLIED
WITH RELATING TO MERCURY AND BIOHAZARDOUS WASTE.
In addition, based on meter readings, decontamination may be required, at which time the Fire
Department's decontamination procedures shall be initiated.
MERCURY RELEASE IN A RESIDENCE
The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality has determined that a mercury release that occurs in
a residence, including the interior of apartments, is household hazardous waste. As a

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

MERCURY RELEASES

Page 4 of 4

result, the release is exempt from cleanup requirements. This does not, however, eliminate the need
for response, evaluation of the hazard, and educating the homeowner/occupant.
Note: A mercury release in common public areas such as pool-side or exit corridors at apartment
complexes, condominiums, etc. would require compliance with the commercial facility section of this
management procedure.
FIRE DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS PERSONNEL
When responding to the report of a mercury release in a residence, including the interior of apartments,
the Fire Department shall:
1. Have the Dispatch Center page Fire Prevention and Special Operations personnel requesting
response.
2. Recommend to the homeowner/occupant that no one be allowed to enter the affected area until the
hazard has been evaluated.
FIRE PREVENTION PERSONNEL
Fire Prevention personnel will explain to the homeowner/occupant of the hazards associated with the
release of mercury and document on a 91-63 that it is the Fire Department's recommendation that a
contractor with the appropriate metering equipment be employed to clean up and remove mercury
contaminated items.
Fire Prevention will submit to the homeowner/occupant, the names and phone numbers of companies
who have the proper mercury testing equipment.
Fire Prevention will also offer financial options that may be available to the homeowner/occupant such
as homeowners insurance.
SPECIAL OPERATIONS PERSONNEL
Special Operations personnel will assist in the evaluation of the hazards associated with the release.
In addition, Special Operations will verify that the Fire Department's decontamination procedures are
initiated and followed, when deemed necessary.

This procedure is designed to provide basic operational guidelines for managing a radiological incident.
This procedure is for peace-time radiological emergencies and does not specifically apply to nuclear
warfare radiological contamination.
The Fire Department responsibilities during radiological emergencies include rescue, treatment, fire
control/extinguishment, control of contamination spread and alerting responsible experts/agencies.
Actual clean-up and overhaul operations will not normally be a Fire Department responsibility, although
the Fire Department will be responsible for seeing that such operations are completed. Shippers
and/or manufacturers of radiological materials will normally be responsible for clean-up operations
using trained clean-up personnel and equipment.
DISPATCH
The Dispatch Center will dispatch either a 2-1 assignment or a 1st Alarm assignment, with the
Hazardous Materials Team to any incident reported to involve radiological materials. The size of the
assignment will be based on the location and type of situation reported.
Dispatch will advise responding units of the prevailing wind direction.
When a radiological incident is confirmed, Dispatch will notify:
1. D.P.S. Communications to dispatch personnel from the Arizona Radiation Regulatory
Agency and D.P.S.--C.V.S.S. unit.
2. Phoenix Fire Department personnel with advanced radiological training--(list in
Information File).
3. Maricopa County Civil Defense--on request from Command.
SITE OPERATIONS
At the scene, Command must consider both direct radiation exposure and contamination. If there is no
life hazard, rescue situation or fire, there is no reason to risk exposure of Fire Department personnel.
First arriving units should secure a perimeter, evaluate the situation and wait for the arrival of the
Hazardous Materials Team.
If the immediate commitment of personnel is necessary, Limited Access Zone procedures shall be
implemented to minimize the exposure and contain the spread of contamination.
The entry of personnel shall be limited to the absolute minimum number and time required for the
urgent situation. These personnel will use full protective clothing and SCBA.
Any commitment of personnel to the Limited Access Zone shall include at least one survey instrument
per team to monitor radiation hazard levels. Dosimeters shall be issued to all personnel operating at
the scene.

PHOENIX REGIONAL

Page 2 of 4

Hazard Zone tape shall be stretched to define an area where readings of 2MR/hr are detectable. This
must take into account potential downwind spread of contamination. Hazardous Materials Team
personnel will determine readings and define the Limited Access Zone.
A Decontamination Area must be established within the perimeter of the Hot Zone, adjacent to the
Lobby Control (entrance/exit) point. All personnel and equipment leaving the Hot Zone must be
checked for radioactive contamination by qualified personnel. All persons or items must go to the
Decontamination Area before leaving the Hot Zone. (See Decontamination.)
Patients requiring treatment, who cannot immediately be decontaminated, must be placed in an
isolated Treatment Area, away from other patients and inside the Hot Zone perimeter.
TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Incidents With Fire:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

Initiate normal tactical firefighting operations.
Always approach from upwind.
Do not ventilate.
Minimize the use of water.
Control water runoff-impound for disposal.
Minimize exposure of personnel.
Use full protective clothing with SCBA.

Rescue/EMS Incidents:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Remove patients quickly.
Treat patients for medical problems/injuries.
Alert hospitals to prepare for contaminated patients.
Use full protective clothing and SCBA.
Decontaminate vehicles used to Transport.

NUCLEAR WEAPONS
The radiological hazard of nuclear weapons in transit is similar to other radioactive materials and can
be handled with similar tactics.
These weapons however, contain considerable amounts of high explosives which may be shock
sensitive and can detonate very easily. They are especially dangerous when the weapon has broken
up and the high explosive is scattered about. If a nuclear weapon involves fire, evacuate the area of
2,000 feet, in all directions, immediately. All down wind areas must be checked for contamination.

TREATMENT OF CONTAMINATED PATIENTS
Do not delay field treatment of injuries. Radiological contamination, itself, is not a medical emergency.
Treatment of contaminated patients should proceed with the following precautions:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

All contaminated patients should be placed in one Treatment Area--separate from
noncontaminated patients--within the Hot Zone perimeter, but beyond the 2 MR/hr
exposure distance.
All treatment personnel should use SCBA or dust-filtering type masks, long sleeve shirts
or coats, gloves and nomex hoods.
A mask or other airway filtering means should be used on the patient to limit
Inhalation/ingestion of airborne contamination.
Bandage all open wounds as quickly as possible to prevent wound contamination.
Carefully peeling or cutting of outer clothing from the patient's body will remove most of
the contamination.
Removed clothing, watches, wallets, etc., must be placed in plastic bags or other
appropriate containers, sealed and properly identified.
A clean plastic bag or other clothing should be placed over the patient's scalp hair to
minimize the spread of contamination. Do not cover face.
Much of the contamination on a patient's skin can be removed by wiping with a moist
cloth or tape (put in plastic bag afterwards).
Hot spots of contamination on the patient's body that cannot be removed by wiping, etc.,
should be marked with ink outline or tape.
Before transporting, all contaminated patients must be wrapped in blankets or sheets to
completely cover them in order to limit the spread of contamination. Only the face
should be left exposed.
Hospitals and rescues must be alerted early and before patient transportation is initiated
so they can prepare to receive radioactive contaminated patients.
All contaminated patients should be sent to a single hospital or to as few as possible.
Once contaminated, these hospitals could be out-of-service for some time.
Where there are large numbers of contaminated patients, place as many patients as
possible in each rescue to minimize contamination spread to other rescues.
Reuse of contaminated rescues for contaminated patient transportation should be
considered. If all available rescues become contaminated, these vehicles can be out-ofservice for long periods of time until they can be decontaminated.
Before treatment personnel can be released from the scene, they must be checked for
contamination and decontaminated. All equipment used in patient treatment must also
be checked and decontaminated. This evaluation will be conducted in the
Decontamination Area.

Personnel may be contaminated with alpha or beta radioactive emitting material at any radiological
incident. In order to prevent any health risk to personnel and to control the spread of the
contamination, the following steps should be taken:
•

All personnel (both fire and civilian) that were inside the Hot Zone must not be released
from the zone until they have been surveyed with radiation detection instruments and
decontaminated if necessary.

•

Contaminated personnel leaving the Hot Zone must pass through the Decontamination
Area. (See sketch)

•

All personnel reporting to the Decontamination Area will remain fully dressed in
protective gear, including gloves and SCBA (facepiece in place).

•

No smoking, drinking or food consumption will be permitted until all exposed personnel
are determined to be free from contamination.

•

All contaminated clothing and equipment must be removed and held in the
Decontamination Area.

Plastic bags or plastic trash containers must be utilized to contain contaminated clothing and
equipment. (City plastic trash containers are excellent for this purpose and may be confiscated from
any nearby residential area or obtained through the City Sanitation Department.)
Removal of Contaminated Equipment and Clothing
All radioactively contaminated equipment and clothing must be placed in plastic containers at one of
three collection points (see diagram).
1. At the first survey point all personnel will be checked in with monitoring instruments. If not
contaminated, personnel may leave the Warm Zone via Lobby Control.
2. Contaminated personnel will place coat, boots and bunker pants in the first container,
continuing to maintain SCBA facepiece in place. All items must be gently handled to avoid
spreading dust (radioactive particles) and using gloves at all times. Actions should avoid
contaminating inner clothing, skin and particularly hands. SCBA harness and cylinder must
be carried to second container.
3. After the second container, personnel will again be checked and, if free of contamination,
may be released from the Hot Zone. If still contaminated, personnel must proceed to the
third container.
4. At the third collection point, all outer clothing will be removed and personnel will be checked
again with monitoring instruments. If still contaminated, personnel must shower at the site,
using a portable shower and soap. Showering must pay particular attention to body areas
which may collect contaminants (armpits, hair, fingernails, etc.) and avoid runoff into eyes or
ears.

PHOENIX REGIONAL

Following showers, personnel will again be surveyed for contamination, before being issued with clean
coveralls.
NOTE:

Shower runoff water must be impounded and collected. All personnel released from the Hot
Zone shall be directed to shower and shampoo and put on clean clothes as soon as
possible after the incident. Medical evaluation will be arranged for all exposed personnel as
quickly as feasible.

FLAMMABLE LIQUID INCIDENTS
M.P. 204.04

03/09-R

Page 1 of 3

PURPOSE
The purpose of this M.P. is to describe standard operating procedures for response to incidents
involving flammable liquids. The four primary areas of concern are extinguishment of flammable
liquid fires, spills without fire, disposal and firefighter safety.
Flammable liquids present particular problems for fire protection, health, safety, and environmental
protection. The frequency of encounters with flammable liquids makes them a particular concern for
the fire department.
The main operational problems with flammable liquids are fire extinguishment, ignition prevention, and
disposal of spills. All three of these may be involved in the same incident.
EXTINGUISHMENT
The preferred agent for flammable liquid fire fighting is AFFF/Class B Foam (Aqueous Film Forming
Foam). Fire apparatus that carry AFFF/Class B Foam are designated with a CBF (Class B Foam) in
CAD and are available on request through Phoenix Regional Dispatch if not already on the incident.
Attack on any flammable liquid fire should be made with Class B Foam when available. When the fuel
is ethanol, or ethanol based (E-10, E-85 or E-95), fire attack should utilize an Alcohol Resistant
Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AR-AFFF) due to the high alcohol content of the fuel. The use of alcohol
resistant class B foam is also required when dealing with any polar (water soluble) flammable liquid.
The class B foam should be applied at the percentages specified by the foam concentrate
manufacturer.
The PFD currently uses AFFF/AR class B foam concentrate on all class B foam equipped apparatus
except for Sky Harbor Airport apparatus. The class B concentrate used by the Airport is AFFF and does
not have the alcohol resistive characteristics needed for polar flammable liquids.
The extinguishing action of Class B Foam is based on its ability to rapidly cover the flammable liquid
surface with a film. This film prevents the escape of flammable vapors, but may have difficulty sealing
against hot metal surfaces. The application of Class B Foam should be gentle to avoid breaking the
seal and agitating the liquid below.
Dry Class A compressed air foam (CAFS @1%) can be used to extinguish a small flammable liquid fire
i.e. a car with leaking fuel tank. It must be understood that while CAFS can be used as an
extinguishing agent, Class A foam has NO ability to suppress vapors and reignition is an extreme
possibility. If extinguiment with CAFS is being performed during a rescue, continuious application of
new foam is required as long as crews are in the hazard zone.
Fires involving a large area of burning flammable liquids may exceed the ability of one hand line to
extinguish. It may be more important for Command to wait until there is enough Class B foam on site to
initiate a coordinated attack. One 95 GPM class B foam line is needed for every 600 square feet of
spill area. The initial fire attack will require 187 gallons of concentrate when used at 3% and 374
gallons of concentrate when used at 6%. Water master streams should be used to cool and protect
exposures during the interim.

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

FLAMMABLE LIQUID INCIDENTS
M.P. 204.04

03/09-R

Page 2 of 3

SPILLS
Flammable liquid spills include spills without fire and any remaining fuel after a fire has been
extinguished. In both of these cases, the liquid must be protected to prevent ignition until it can be
picked up or removed.
All personnel working around spills must wear full protective clothing to afford protection in case of
possible ignition. SCBA must be used in vapor areas. Vapor areas can only be found through the use
of combustible gas indicators carried by all Special Operations Response Team units. A Hazardous
Materials Response Team company should be dispatched to test the atmosphere if there is a potential
question about the flammability.
1. Do not permit the flammable liquid to run-off into storm drains, sewers, or drainage systems. Dam
the run-off and cover drains and sewers pending disposal. Consider the use of plastic dike,
charged hose lines, black plastic, or dirt to prevent the further spread of spilled material if it can be
done safely.
2. Control ignition sources in the area of the spill. Extinguish pilot lights, flares, open flames, etc.
Prohibit smoking. Position vehicles to prevent contact of vapor with running engines or exhaust.
Disconnect electrical power from a remote location to prevent arc-caused ignition.
3. Cover spills with class B foam to seal vapors. The application will need to be repeated regularly, as
the seal will break down in l0 to 15 minutes. One 95 GPM class B foam line is needed for every
600 square feet of spill area. The initial application will require 43 gallons of concentrate when used
at 3% and 86 gallons of concentrate when used at 6%. Haz-Mat crews will need to check for
escaping vapors with a combustible gas indicator to judge when the seal is breaking down.

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

FLAMMABLE LIQUID INCIDENTS
M.P. 204.04

DISPOSAL
1. Large quantity spills should be disposed of by a specialized hazardous materials clean-up
contractor per C99. This may require a fuel transfer pump or vacuum truck and personnel familiar
with fuel transfer precautions.
2. Smaller spills, which cannot be picked up with a tanker, must be absorbed if it has not already
evaporated.
3. Special Operations carries small amounts of absorbent but the most often used and preferred
method is using sand delivered by the Streets Department. Larger spills will require a street
sweeper or a licensed clean-up contractor to remove the sand depending on the Jurisdiction Having
Authority (JHA).
4. The Spiller must be given the opportunity to clean up his spill if he can do so, while adhering to
appropriate regulations. Otherwise, a specialized hazardous materials cleanup contractor will be
called.
5. Large quanity spills require the response of a unit from the Hazardous Materials Response Team in
addition to Car 957.
SAFETY
As early as possible, a hazard zone should be established and marked through the use of fire line tape.
This zone should include the spilled material in the area down wind of the spill of sufficient distance to
account for reasonable vapor travel:
All personnel working in the hazard zone must wear full protective clothing including SCBA with
face piece on.
Unless absolutely necessary, personnel shall not work in a spill area. When this is necessary to
perform a rescue or to control a leak, the spill must be covered with foam and all possible
precautions against ignition must be taken. The area shall be monitored with a combustible gas
indicator.
FIRE CODE VIOLATIONS
Most flammable liquid incidents involve Fire Code violations. Have the Dispatch Center dispatch Car
99 to investigate this aspect of the incident and take appropriate action.

APPLICATION OF CLASS “B” FOAM/AFFF CONTAINING PFAS
M.P. 204.04A

12/24-N

Page 1 of 5

PURPOSE
The purpose of this MP is to define the circumstances that require the application of Class
B Firefighting Foam/AFFF(Aqueous Film Forming Foam) that contains PFAS.
Not all Class B Foams or AFFF contain PFAS. This MP only refers to the operational use
and responsibilities after application of Class B Foams or AFFF containing PFAS.

DEFINITIONS
A hazardous chemical is any chemical that is classified as a physical or health hazard.
A chemical is a physical hazard if it is likely to burn or support fire.
A chemical is a health hazard if there is significant evidence that acute or chronic health
effects may occur in exposed employees.
Flash point is the minimum temperature at which a liquid gives off vapor in sufficient
concentration to form an ignitable mixture with air near the surface of the liquid.
A liquid is flammable if it has a flash point below 141F.
A liquid is combustible if it has a flashpoint between 140-200F.
Class “B” Foam/Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) that contains PFAS is typically used
to extinguish highly flammable or combustible liquid class B fires, such as fires involving
fuel tankers (e.g. over-the-road or railroad), aircraft and oil refineries.
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of man-made
chemicals. Examples of where PFAS can be found include cleaners, textiles, leather,
paper and paints, fire-fighting foams, and wire insulation.

BACKGROUND:
The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) urges Arizona’s fire
departments and emergency responders to take extreme care to minimize the release of
Class B Firefighting Foam/AFFF containing PFAS into the environment. Uncontrolled
release of PFAS to the environment has the potential to create adverse impacts to public
health and the environment if it reaches drinking water, ground water or surface water.
Exposures in the workplace can also occur if skin contact occurs with concentrated
products or through inhalation. Certain PFAS can accumulate and stay in the human
body for long periods of time and there is evidence that exposure to PFAS can lead to
adverse health outcomes in humans.
As of January 1, 2020, Arizona Revised Statute (ARS) § 36-1696 states that no person,
local government, or state agency may discharge or use class B firefighting foam that
contains intentionally added PFAS chemicals for training or testing purposes unless

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

APPLICATION OF CLASS “B” FOAM/AFFF CONTAINING PFAS
M.P. 204.04A

12/24-N

Page 2 of 5

otherwise required by law or conducted at a facility that provides containment, treatment,
and disposal measures that prevent uncontrolled releases into the environment.
The statute does not restrict the manufacture, sale or distribution of class B firefighting
foam containing intentionally added PFAS or the use of the foam in emergency
firefighting or fire prevention operations.
The Code of Federal Regulation’s Occupational Safety and Health Standards within Title
29, Part 1910, Subpart Z, § 1910.1200, requires that employers communicate to its
employees any hazardous chemicals that are known to be present in the workplace, their
associated hazards, how to protect themselves, and provide training in their use.

OPERATIONS
Our Standard Operating Procedures combined with federal and state regulations provide
our department guidance on the use of Class B Firefighting Foam/AFFF containing PFAS
at emergency incidents. We must always begin with the question, “Why are we taking
risks at this incident?”(MP.201.01C, Risk Management and Safety). The critical factors that
are present will help us answer this question by indicating the tactical priorities (MP
202.02A, Tactical Objectives) that must be addressed and assist us in creating an incident
action plan. Critical factors on an incident involving the release of flammable and or
combustible liquids include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

life safety of civilians and that of our members
outside ambient and surface level temperatures
flash point and amount of the product released
if the released flammable liquid has ignited
protection of property that is a potential exposure
soil and nearby storm drains or waterways that are environmental exposures

If a flammable or combustible liquid that is accidentally released has a flash point that is
approaching ambient or surface level temperatures and the amount of product released
threatens life safety or property if ignited, then the application of Class B Firefighting
Foam/AFFF containing PFAS should be considered. If the same liquid ignites, Class B
Firefighting Foam/AFFF containing PFAS should be applied to reduce the products of
combustion. If a large amount (55 gallons or more) of a flammable or combustible liquid
is accidentally released, but there is no threat to life safety or property, then Class B
Firefighting Foam/AFFF containing PFAS should not be applied to the liquid. Application
in this instance produces an unnecessary exposure to personnel and may inhibit the
ability to control the release of hazardous chemicals (both flammable or combustible
liquids and Class B Firefighting Foam/AFFF containing PFAS) into the environment.
Permit Required
Any section that uses Class B Firefighting Foam/AFFF containing PFAS, on an incident,
will be required to complete the use permit, attach a Chemical Reference Worksheet, and
is responsible for the maintenance of the record. A copy of the permit must also be

PHOENIX REGIONAL

submitted to the Safety and Prevention section to support documentation and tracking of
Toxic Exposure reports from the incident.
Personal Protection and Decontamination
If the decision is made to apply Class B Firefighting Foam/AFFF containing PFAS during
an incident, the following must be addressed,
•
•
•
•
•

•

The Incident Commander must inform all crews that Class B Firefighting
Foam/AFFF containing PFAS is being applied.
Hazard Sector must inform any nearby crews of application.
All personnel operating in the hot zone (MP 204.01, Hazardous Materials) must
wear their turnouts and use their SCBA.
Crews must make every effort to avoid contact with any applied Class B
Firefighting Foam/AFFF containing PFAS.
Members who are outside of the hot zone in a support role and are handling and
supplying open containers of Class B Firefighting Foam/AFFF containing PFAS to
operations personnel in a forward position, must wear personal protective
equipment. This includes a chemical splash protection garment, chemical resistant
gloves, and an N-95 particle mask.
If exposed to Class B Firefighting Foam/AFFF containing PFAS, crews must adhere
to the Fireground Exposure Reduction Policy, MP206.02.

Notifications and Reporting Requirements
The application of Class B Firefighting Foam Class B Firefighting Foam/AFFF containing
PFAS on an incident, will require notifications to C99 and the Arizona Department of
Environmental Quality (ADEQ) to coordinate clean-up and remediation. The Safety and
Prevention section must also be contacted to initiate a Toxic Exposure Notification.

The Phoenix Regional Automatic Aid System responds to thousands of incidents each
year that involve natural gas. We must remain cognizant of the hazards associated with
gas emergencies, the need to meter, control gas leaks and evacuate those threatened.
Most important of all, we must remain vigilant and prevent complacency.
Natural gas (Methane) is extremely flammable, lighter than air, is colorless and
odorless. Due to these characteristics, Mercaptan is added to natural gas to help indicate
its presence and will result in an odor like rotten eggs. The flammable range of natural
gas is 4 percent Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) to 15 percent Upper Explosive Limit (UEL) by
volume. Although natural gas is non-toxic, it can displace oxygen, which can
cause asphyxiation in certain settings. The presence of natural gas in its flammable
range can be evaluated with the use of a Combustible Gas Indicator. This is
done by the Hazardous Materials Response Teams (HMRT) and/or the appropriate utility
company.
Fires involving natural gas should be controlled by stopping the flow of gas. In most
cases, burning natural gas should not be extinguished as this would change the situation
from a visible to an invisible hazard with an explosive potential. Because natural gas is
lighter than air, if confined it has the potential for a catastrophic explosion. Natural gas
leaks above ground are much easier to manage than below ground leaks.
PROCEDURE
Fire Department units may encounter natural gas in a variety of situations and incident
types, each presenting a unique set of hazards. These incidents can range from a simple
check odor to potential major incidents involving natural gas explosions. The following
guidelines present an approach which will be applicable in many situations, but do not
replace good judgment and experience when dealing with any incident. Incidents
involving natural gas should be managed using the risk management profile and
strategic decision-making model (M.P. 201.01C).
PERSONNEL SAFETY
Per M.P. 202.05B, all personnel working in the vicinity of a potential explosion or fire
area, including gas leaks and fuel spills, shall wear full protective clothing with SCBA,
face piece donned and breathing air. A Hot Zone shall be established and defined by
"fire line" tape. Personnel working in the hot zone, (e.g. attempting to secure a gas leak),
shall be protected by a hose line. The number of exposed personnel will be kept to a
minimum while still assuring crew accountability and a minimum of two personnel.

ACTIONS OF THE FIRST ARRIVING FIRE DEPARTMENT UNIT (NON HAZ-MAT)
• Perform a scene size up and establish Command. Consciously avoid committing
apparatus or personnel to a dangerous situation or a situation that could become
dangerous due to gas migration.
• Attempt to locate the homeowner or other RP and begin to gather information as
to the hazard, potential victims, etc.
• Evacuate the area, working towards an “All Clear” of the immediate area and
surrounding structures if necessary.
• Isolate the area/scene – Establishment of a “Hot Zone” is critical.
• Deny entry.
• If incident is determined to be a natural gas leak, ensure that personnel safety
practices are in place when working in the Hot Zone including the wearing of the
appropriate PPE with SCBA, face piece donned and breathing air. Establish a
water supply and ensure that a charged hose line is in place. This line must be
attended when Haz-Mat crews or gas company personnel are securing the leak.

• Ensure that a charged hose line is in place and manned when Haz-Mat crews or
gas company personnel are securing the leak.
• Contact initial crews, the RP, and gas company personnel (if on scene) to gather
information about the hazard.
• Reevaluate the initial Hot Zone using metering devices, including Combustible
Gas
Indicators (CGI), and adjust the
boundaries as necessary
based
upon the situation and meter readings.
• Gather necessary tools and equipment needed to mitigate the hazard.
• In situations where gas company personnel are needed to assist with the
mitigation efforts, ensure that they are dressed in the appropriate PPE including
SCBA’s.
INCIDENTS INVOLVING A REPORTED GAS LEAK - NO FIRE OR EXPLOSION
Calls for "odor of gas," "gas leak," "broken gas line" and similar situations may range
from minor to major incidents. Each of these scenarios should be approached as

Page |3

Page 3 of 6

potentially dangerous situations. Although there is not a visible hazard, fire or explosion,
the situation can change instantly. Uncontrolled flammable gas leaks should never be
approached with a “routine” mindset. Safe and effective operations necessitate
appropriate size up, approach, establishing and controlling the perimeter, and hazard
mitigation.
In all cases, Fire Department units shall take appropriate actions, using the Risk
Management Profile (M.P.201.01c) to provide for life safety and property conservation.
If gas company personnel are on the scene of an incident prior to arrival of fire crews, the
best practice is for the first arriving Fire Department unit to make contact with the onscene gas company and determine needs. Gas company personnel shall be responsible
for locating and eliminating the source of the leak. Gas company personnel and/or the
Hazardous Materials Response Team shall obtain a sufficient number of gas
concentration readings, using various tools, including combustible gas indicators for
Command to evaluate the hazard and take appropriate action.
The Hazardous Materials Plan (M.P. 204.01) should be used as a basic guide for these
incidents. A minimum number of personnel should be allowed to enter the area to sizeup the situation while any additional unit’s stage outside the hazard zone, preferably up
wind of the incident.
In addition to evacuating, isolating, and denying entry, non-tech fire crews can attempt to
locate the source of the gas and any shutoff devices available.
•

If the location of the incident is a SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING and the source of
the leak can be identified it would be appropriate to secure the gas to the
appliance or meter if needed. Wait for the arrival of Haz-Mat crews if a source of
the leak cannot be located.

•

If the location of the incident is a COMMERCIAL OCCUPANCY OR OTHER LARGE
OCCUPANCY (e.g. large warehouses, hospitals, etc.) refrain from attempting to
secure the natural gas unless there is an immediate life hazard. Securing the gas
main is often difficult to accomplish due to the size and complexity of the
occupancy. Best practices should include evacuation, isolation, and the denial of
entry until Haz-Mat crews and/or gas company personnel arrive on scene.

05/21

Page 4 of 6

If the location of the incident involves an APARTMENT COMPLEX, the best
practice is to try and determine the source of the leak. If you can isolate
the leak at an appliance, secure the source, (e.g. incoming gas line at the dryer or
stove). If the leak is at a bank of meters, best practices should include evacuation,
isolation, and the denial of entry until Haz-Mat crews arrive on scene.

Gas leak situations within a building where the source of the leak is unknown or
uncontrolled, the gas supply should be shut off at the meter. This should only be done in
coordination with on scene HazMat units, C957 or Gas Company representative.
If there is any indication of gas accumulating within a building, evacuate occupants from
the structure, isolate the area and deny re-entry and await the arrival of HazMat
units. Attempting to secure ignition sources, e.g. turning off power, can lead to an
explosion. If there is imminent life safety concern, use the appropriate actions
necessary following the Risk Management Plan (M.P.201.01c).
First arriving Hazardous Materials Response Team (HMRT) should be assigned
Hazard Sector and should initiate metering the area to re-evaluate the established Hot
Zone boundaries. Hazard Sector will assess their ability to mitigate the leak. At this
time Hazard sector should work with other utility companies to secure ignition sources
including electricity. Securing electricity may not take place onsite but at a remote
location. Hazard sector should consider ventilating the structure using natural ventilation
and/or intrinsically safe equipment if available. Battery operated equipment does not
necessarily mean intrinsically safe.
Hazard Sector should work with the gas company to obtain sufficient number of gas
concentration readings in the event the leak has not been identified. If gas company
personnel are actively securing the leak in the HOT ZONE, fire department crews
shall provide stand-by protection with a charged 1 ¾ hand line and minimum of two
firefighters in appropriate PPE with SCBA, face piece donned and breathing air.
Operating personnel should remain pessimistic in their approach to reported gas leaks
and should utilize HMRT crews and the utility company resources to rule out any
potential hazards.

INCIDENTS AT WHICH AN EXPLOSION OR FIRE HAS OCCURRED
Units arriving at the scene of a structural explosion must consider natural gas as a
possible cause and recognize the potential signs including a debris field, and/or structural
damage.
Explosions have occurred in structures which were not served by natural
gas. Underground leaks may migrate considerable distances before entering a structure
through the foundation, around pipes, or through void spaces. When natural gas
migrates in this manner, Mercaptan may be scrubbed as the gas travels underground
leaving the gas truly odorless. In these circumstances, the cause of the explosion may be
difficult to determine.
First arriving crew should perform the following:
1. Effective size up, recognize the signs of a gas explosion.
2. Determine the presence of victims, their condition, and triage.
3. Identify immediate hazards (e.g., collapse, leaking gas, fire, etc.).
4. Develop an incident action plan, consideration given to the need for rescue of
trapped occupants, structural collapse and/or integrity, treatment, fire control, etc.
Also, address accomplishment of an “All Clear” on involved structure and
surrounding structures (evacuation).
Until it can be determined that the area is safe from the danger of further explosions,
evacuate all civilians and keep the number of Fire Department and/or other emergency
personnel (e.g., gas company) in the area to the minimum number necessary to stabilize
the situation. Take a pessimistic point of view.
The Incident Commander must establish a Hazard Sector as soon as possible. Hazard
Sector should establish Hot, Warm, Cold, and No-Entry Zones as necessary. The Hot
Zone should include any areas where gas detection equipment identifies reading of 10 %
of the LEL (0.4% gas) or greater. If a gas concentration is encountered inside, adjacent to,
or underneath any building, secure all possible sources of ignition in the affected area.
HazMat crews will, in coordination with utility company personnel, secure electricity
from outside the affected area to avoid arcing if necessary. Before securing any potential
ignition source, evaluation and metering should take place. Hazard Sector should
consider ventilating the structure using natural ventilation and/or intrinsically safe
equipment if available. Battery operated equipment does not necessarily mean
intrinsically safe.

Page 6 of 6

Use combustible gas indicators to systematically check all suspected areas. Start outside
of the area of the explosion and move into the area until readings indicate detectable
concentration. Both gas company personnel and the HMRT will establish warm and hot
zones.
The use of ground probes is essential to evaluate potential underground leaks. However,
in extraordinary circumstances, such as migration of gas in a sewer system, ground
probes may not be sufficient and other detection devices may be required. When gas
company personnel are on the scene, ground probe readings and locations must be
coordinated.
Command shall provide for effective interaction between gas company personnel and the
Fire Department. Gas company personnel are responsible for locating and eliminating
leaks in the gas system. As industry specialists, they can provide Command with
valuable assistance in the effective handling of these incidents. In all cases, C957 or
Haz Mat Company Officer, will be required to supervise during on-site operations.
Command must ensure the safety and stability of all involved structures. If further
collapse is possible and a life safety hazard exists, Technical Rescue Teams and other
specialty resources should be called to provide for structural stabilization. Additional
appropriate resources should be requested as needed. (e.g., C99 should be
dispatched and structural engineers requested if necessary).

This procedure establishes policy and procedures for all personnel involved in making atmospheric
measurements using monitoring instruments.
PURPOSE
The purpose of this policy and procedure is to establish the highest level of accuracy for atmospheric
monitoring instruments. This will allow the user and field personnel to operate in high levels of
instrument accuracy. This ongoing methodology for spanning and calibrating of atmospheric monitoring
instruments should ensure the highest level of safety for all personnel.
RESPONSIBILITIES
It shall be the responsibility of all members using, or supervising the use of, atmospheric monitoring
instruments to span and/or calibrate these devices in the following manner.
SPANNING
Spanning and/or calibration shall be done on each instrument (except RMD* instruments) prior to
making entry into the following atmospheres:
• contaminated atmospheres
• atmospheres which may suddenly become contaminated
• atmospheres where there is suspected oxygen deficiency
• atmospheres which are suspected of being contaminated or oxygen deficient
or at any other time it may be necessary to render an instrument in a ready state of condition. This
instrument will be spanned on the proper calibration gas, hose and regulator to ensure the instrument
of choice is in proper operating condition. At any time the instrument does not span or calibrate
correctly, and you cannot resolve the problem, you will not use the instrument. You will then bring the
instrument to the Special Operations Section and change out for another instrument.
TRACKING
To keep track of all the spanning and calibration being performed on all atmospheric monitoring
instruments, a Control Log has been developed. It is called the "Meter Calibration and Span Control
Log." This Control Log will be used to document weekly calibration and spanning being done prior to
the use of the instruments. The form will be completed on a monthly basis and forwarded to the
Special Operations Sector.
Calibration of instruments shall be on a weekly basis to ensure proper maintenance is being performed
on all instruments, according to manufacturer's recommendations. Calibration of all instruments
(except RMD* instruments) shall be performed at the Special Operations Section on a monthly basis
and logged into master control file for each instrument. This master control file shall act as a legal
history of that instrument's performance.

SCOPE
The number of clandestine drug laboratories has increased dramatically in recent years. The
number of seizures, "busts," or "raids," made by law enforcement agencies has also increased.
Clandestine drug laboratory investigations, seizures, and arrests of suspects are all police
department or law enforcement agency matters. However, local law enforcement agencies are
calling upon fire department hazardous incident response teams for assistance during raids and for
advice on safety matters.
POLICY
The Phoenix Fire Department will provide limited support for police departments and other
agencies, when requested, at sites of clandestine drug laboratories. Support may consist of, but
is not limited to: providing research and information on chemicals that are suspected or are
known to be in the laboratory, remote exterior air monitoring, and decontamination of police entry
personnel.
HAZARDS
Substitution of proper equipment with unsafe items is prevalent in low budget clandestine
laboratory operations. For example, pressure cookers have been substituted for three neck flasks
in the initial cooking stage of methamphetamine. Without ventilation, this type of operation can
easily generate toxic levels of phosphine gas.
Booby traps have been left in place and armed when a lab is abandoned. Opening or moving
doors, windows, refrigerator doors, chemical containers, or furniture may be a triggering
mechanism for an explosive device or chemical reaction that is lethal. Trip wires made from
monofilament fishing line may be strung across doorways, hallways, or across rooms to activate
different types of devices. It is imperative that nothing is moved, shut off, turned on, or touched,
at a laboratory, whether it is operational or abandoned. Electric switches, vacuum pumps,
glassware, chemical containers, or anything that is plugged into a wall outlet should not be
touched. Water sources, especially to reflux or condensing towers, should not be shut off.
Shutting off the water supply to a cooking process can result in an explosion.
INDICATORS
Personnel should be aware of the indications of potential clandestine drug laboratories when
responding to EMS, fire, check odor, or an other service request. Common indicators are:
•
•
•
•
•

Unusual odors like ether, acetic, solvents, and odors of urea.
Glassware that is normally associated with school or industrial laboratories, such as flasks,
beakers, flasks with vacuum ports, glass cooling towers, and funnels.
Heating elements, hot plates, or heating mantles.
Vacuum pumps, plastic or rubber tubing.
Marked and unmarked chemical containers of various sizes.

SUSPECTED DRUG LABORATORY OPERATION - NOTIFICATION PROCESS
Personnel that encounter a suspected laboratory should withdraw to a safe location as soon as it
is possible, using discretion on actions and radio conversation. The on-duty Battalion Chief, the
Police Department, and the Special Operations duty person should be notified of the situation. If
a situation warrants additional immediate action (e.g. evacuation of surrounding areas, several
victims, a chemical release or spill), the Dispatch Center should be requested to send the
appropriate level of a hazardous materials assignment. Command should also request the
response of the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) Emergency Response Division.
NOTIFICATION FOR USE OF H.I.R.T. UNITS
Any agency requesting the Hazardous Incident Response Team for assistance during seizure of a
clandestine drug laboratory shall contact the Duty Deputy or Car 94 for scheduling of the
Hazardous Incident Response Team. The agency that is requesting the assistance shall provide
information on location, time, staging area, and the type of assistance that is needed. A preincident meeting shall be scheduled between the agency and Car 94 to address the concerns
noted above. Security of information will be strictly adhered to.
The Duty Deputy, District Commander, and Battalion Chief of the affected district/battalion will be
notified at an appropriate time, but in all cases, at the time entry is made. Such notification will
be initiated by Car 94.
TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The recognition of the presence of a clandestine drug laboratory that is involved in a fire may not
occur until after fire control has been achieved. The initial indications of the presence of a
laboratory may be subtle or very apparent. Depending on the products involved, a fire in a lab
can spread faster and burn with more intensity that what might normally be expected. The color
of the flames may appear to be an unusually bright or dark orange, or the flames may be of
several different colors. An unusual color of smoke or odor may also be present.
A laboratory that is involved in a fire situation should be viewed pessimistically by Command.
Command should request the Dispatch Center to send balance of the appropriate level of a
hazardous materials assignment. A defensive mode may be appropriate for personnel safety.
Standard protective clothing and SCBA use may not afford complete protection. An acceptable
alternative is to protect any exposures and allow the fire to burn, providing the products of
combustion being generated are not complicating the problem further. Run-off may also create a
problem and diking may be necessary.

HEALTH AND SAFETY
Personnel showing any signs or symptoms of a chemical exposure during or after any incident
involving a laboratory or a suspected laboratory should be treated and transported to Poison
Control, providing that the exposure is not a critical life threatening emergency. Critical life
threatening injuries require transport to the closest hospital. All potentially exposed personnel and
equipment must be decontaminated. All potentially exposed personnel should complete a
Hazardous Materials Exposure Report Form (91-38D). Exposed equipment, especially protective
clothing, may have to be properly disposed of. Notification of Health and Fitness Deputy,
Exposure Control Officer, and Safety Officer shall be made.
ENTRY
Phoenix Fire Department personnel will not participate in a law enforcement agency entry
operation into a suspected and unsecured clandestine drug laboratory. Security shall mean that
the Police Department Bomb Squad and S.A.U. teams have surveyed the area and all suspects are
in custody, and confirmation that the building has been searched and no explosive devices were
found. Phoenix Fire Department personnel may make an entry into a secured drug laboratory if an
emergency situation involving hazardous materials develops and if the safety of Phoenix Fire
Department personnel is not jeopardized.
Prior to taking any action at a suspected clandestine drug laboratory, the Phoenix Fire Department
will request the response of a representative of the Department of Environmental Quality
Emergency Response Division. If a representative from the Department of Environmental Quality
is unable to respond directly to the location of the incident, every effort will be made to contact a
representative by telephone to inform them of the situation. This shall be accomplished by the
Special Operations duty person.
ADDITIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENT RESOURCE
Additional resource requirements needed at the site will be determined by the Special Operations
Duty Officer or Battalion Chief. A multi-company response will cause the activation of the
incident command system.
DISPOSAL
Proper disposal of the hazardous material(s) in a clandestine laboratory is the responsibility of the
law enforcement agency that is making the seizure. The law enforcement agency on-scene must
arrange clean-up with the proper contractor.

SCOPE
This procedure establishes a standard structure and guideline for all fire department personnel
operating at incidents involving confined space rescues. The procedure outlines responsibilities
for first-responders, TRT units, Command Officers, and other fire department personnel
responding to such incidents. All other Phoenix Fire Department procedures shall apply to
confined space rescue operations where applicable.
PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines for the response of fire department
personnel and equipment to confined space rescue incidents. Because confined space rescue
operations present a significant danger to fire department personnel, the safe and effective
management of these operations require special considerations. This procedure identifies some
of the critical issues which must be included in managing these incidents.
TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
OSHA Regulations Standard 29 CFR 1910.146 Permit-Required Confined Spaces regulates
entry into confined spaces for general industry and the rescue service and shall be considered
the basis for confined space rescue operations. For the purpose of emergency response, a
confined space is defined as:
•
•
•

A space large enough for personnel to physically enter.
A space not designed for continuous employee occupancy.
An area with limited entry and egress.

Confined spaces include caverns, tunnels, pipes, tanks, mine shafts, utility vaults, and any other
location where ventilation and access are restricted by the configuration of the space. These
factors may also apply to basements and attics. Confined space incidents may involve injured
persons or persons asphyxiated or overcome by toxic substances. Pre-incident planning is an
important factor in preparing to handle these types of incidents.
Due to the inherent dangers associated with these operations, the Phoenix Fire Department
Risk Management Profile shall be applied to all confined space rescue operations and shall be
continuously re-assessed throughout the incident. A phased approach to confined space rescue
operations which include; Arrival, Pre-entry operations, Entry operations, and Termination, can
be utilized to safely and effectively mitigate these high-risk / low-frequency events.

Additional technical information is available in the issued Technical Rescue Field
Operations Guide.

SCOPE
This procedure establishes a standard structure and guideline for all fire department personnel
operating at incidents involving trench rescue operations. The procedure outlines
responsibilities for first-responders, TRT units, Command Officers, and other fire department
personnel responding to such incidents. All other Phoenix Fire Department procedures shall
apply to trench rescue operations where applicable.
PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines for the response of fire department
personnel and equipment to trench rescue incidents. Because trench rescue operations present
a significant danger to fire department personnel, the safe and effective management of these
operations require special considerations. It shall be the policy of the Phoenix Fire Department
that NO personnel shall be allowed into an unsafe trench or excavation. This procedure
identifies some of the critical issues which must be included in managing these incidents.
TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
OSHA Regulations Standard 29 CFR 1926 Subpart P regulates excavations for general industry
and the rescue service and shall be considered the basis for emergency trench rescue
operations. For the purpose of emergency response, an excavation shall be defined by any
depression, hole, trench, or earth wall, man made or natural, of four feet or greater.
Trench collapses generally occur due to unstable soil conditions combined with improper or
inadequate shoring. The potential for additional collapse is considered a primary hazard to
personnel. Removing soil or debris, adding weight near the edge of an open cut, vibration (such
as vehicle movement), rain, or simply the passage of time, may cause additional collapse at any
time during the rescue operation.
Due to the inherent dangers associated with these operations, the Phoenix Fire Department
Risk Management Profile shall be applied to all trench rescue operations and shall be
continuously re-assessed throughout the incident. A phased approach to trench rescue
operations which include; Arrival, Pre-entry operations, Entry operations, and Termination, can
be utilized to safely and effectively mitigate these high-risk / low-frequency events.

Additional technical information is available in the issued Technical Rescue Field
Operations Guide.

II. THE RESCUE PLAN
Rescue operations should be conducted with as little risk to the rescuers as necessary
to affect the rescue. Low-risk operations may not always be possible but should be
considered first. The order of rescue from low-risk to high-risk are:
A. TALK – if water is calm or slow moving, try to talk the victim into self-rescue if
possible.
B. REACH – extend an arm, pike pole, rescue hook, or any other such object to reach
the victim and pull from the water.
C. THROW – attempt to throw the victim(s) a throw-bag rescue line or some other type
of approved safety flotation device and “pendulum-belay” or “haul” the victim(s) to the
bank.
D. ROW - If it is determined that a boat-based operation shall be utilized, Rescue
Sector shall assign a company on the opposite bank to assist in establishing an
anchor for an approved rope system.
E. GO - If it is not possible to row to the victim, Rescue Sector should consider putting a
rescuer or rescuers in the water to reach the victim. This is a very high risk operation
and shall be conducted exclusively by trained TRT personnel. Prior to entering the
water, rescue personnel shall be briefed on the plan, the back-up plan and
emergency procedures. Rescue personnel shall never be attached to a life line
without the benefit of a quick-release mechanism approved for water rescue. Rescue
personnel shall never do a “breath-hold” surface dive in an attempt to locate a victim
beneath the surface of the water.
F. HELO - Helicopter operations are considered high-risk and shall be decided upon
through consultation with Rescue Sector, Safety, Command, and the Technical
Advisor. Prior to considering the use of a helicopter for rescue operations, Command
must determine if a rescue-qualified pilot is available for the rescue operation. If so,
the Pilot In Command (PIC) will have the final say on if and how the helicopter will be
used in the rescue operation.
III. ASSESS THE VICTIM
When the rescuers reach the victim, a primary survey shall be completed. If the
victim is conscious, rescuers should determine if the victim can assist in the rescue.
If the victim is unconscious, the rescue must be completed as quickly as possible.

SCOPE
This procedure establishes a standard structure and guideline for all fire department personnel
operating at incidents involving structural collapse rescue operations. The procedure outlines
responsibilities for first-responders, TRT units, Command Officers, and other fire department
personnel responding to such incidents. All other Phoenix Fire Department procedures shall
apply to structural collapse rescue operations where applicable.
PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines for the response of fire department
personnel and equipment to structural collapse rescue incidents. Because structural collapse
rescue operations present a significant danger to fire department personnel, the safe and
effective management of these operations require special considerations. This procedure
identifies some of the critical issues which must be included in managing these incidents.
TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Due to the inherent dangers associated with these operations, the Phoenix Fire Department
Risk Management Profile shall be applied to all structural collapse rescue operations and shall
be continuously re-assessed throughout the incident. A phased approach to structural collapse
rescue operations which include; Arrival, Pre-rescue operations, Rescue operations, and
Termination, can be utilized to safely and effectively mitigate these high-risk / low-frequency
events.
Additional technical information is available in the issued Technical Rescue Field
Operations Guide.
Phase I

Arrival.

During the Arrival phase of a structural collapse incident, Command must take strong control of
the incident to prevent the situation from quickly deteriorating into a chaotic event. A structural
collapse incident is likely to have unorganized, volunteer rescue efforts being conducted by
civilian personnel which creates an unsafe situation for the volunteers as well as rescuers.
Command must focus attention early on building a strong Command structure that will ensure
the safety of rescue personnel and support this complex campaign operation.
I. ESTABLISH COMMAND
A. First arriving company officer shall assume Command and begin an immediate sizeup of the situation.
B. First arriving TRT unit that is staffed with a TRT Company Officer should be assigned
Rescue Sector. The TRT Company Officer assigned as Rescue Sector should
remain with his crew. Rescue Sector responsibilities include:
•
•
•
•
•

Assuming technical rescue operations control.
Identifying hazards and critical factors.
Developing a rescue plan and back-up plan.
Communicating with and directing TRT resources assigned to Rescue Sector.
Informing Command of conditions, actions, and needs during all phases of the
rescue operation.

D. Following the transfer of Command to a Command Officer, a Technical Advisor
should be assigned to join the Command Team at their location to assist in
managing personnel and resources engaged in the technical aspects of the incident.
The Technical Advisor is responsible for ensuring that the rescue plan developed by
Rescue Sector and communicated to Command is a sound plan in terms of the
safety and welfare of both victim(s) and rescuers. Considerations for the Technical
Advisor include:
•
•
•

A Special Operations qualified Battalion Chief and/or FIT.
One of the Regional Special Operations qualified Safety Officers.
Any experienced TRT Company Officer assigned to the incident.

The Technical Advisor position within the Command Team should be filled prior to the
implementation of any rescue plan proposed by Rescue Sector.
II.

Size-Up
A. Spot apparatus outside of any potential secondary collapse zone.
B. Secure a witness or responsible party to assist in gathering information to determine
exactly what happened. If no witnesses are present, Command may have to look for
clues on the scene to determine what happened.
C. Assess the immediate and potential hazards to the rescuers. Hazards associated
with structural collapse include:
•
•
•
•
•

Secondary collapse.
Explosion and fire.
Broken gas and water lines.
Energized electrical lines.
Falling debris.

D. Isolate immediate hazard area, secure the scene, and deny entry for all non-rescue
personnel.
E. Assess on-scene capabilities and determine the need for additional resources.
Consider establishing Level 2 staging and calling for heavy machinery and
equipment such as cranes and front-end loaders.
Phase II

Pre-rescue Operations

The Phoenix Fire Department is the sponsoring agency of AZ-TF1, which is one of 28 FEMA
Urban Search & Rescue task forces in the nation. This team is highly trained and equipped to
respond to incidents involving structural collapse. Consideration should be given to utilize the
personnel and equipment from this task force for incidents involving structural collapse.

I. MAKE THE GENERAL AREA SAFE
A. Establish a hazard zone perimeter around the collapse area.
•
•

Keep all non-essential rescue personnel out of the hazard zone.
Remove all non-essential civilian personnel at least 150 feet away from the
hazard zone perimeter.

II. MAKE THE RESCUE AREA SAFE
A. Secure all hazards. If it is not possible to secure all hazards, rescue personnel
operating in the area must be made aware of the hazard(s).
B. Establish a Lobby Sector. Command should establish a Lobby Sector to control the
flow and maintain personnel accountability of rescue personnel in the collapse area.
C. Establish a Treatment Sector. Command should establish a Treatment Sector to
identify and set-up a triage and treatment area a safe distance from the collapse
area for the treatment and transportation of victims.
D. Establish a Building Triage team. Rescue Sector should establish a Building Triage
team which shall consist of a Technical Rescue Technician trained and
knowledgeable in structural collapse shoring techniques, a structural engineer, and a
Hazardous Materials Technician. This team will asses the structural integrity and
hazardous conditions of the building(s) involved and will utilize a building marking
system to indicate their findings. Consider establishing additional Building Triage
teams if the area of collapse is widespread and involves numerous buildings.
E. Establish a Search team. Rescue Sector should establish a Search team to search
the collapse area and locate victims. A Search team shall consist of TRT personnel
trained in the use of specialized search equipment, and search canines with their
handlers (if available). Consider establishing additional Search teams if the area of
collapse is widespread and involves numerous buildings.
F. Establish a Rescue team. A Rescue Team shall consist of TRT personnel trained in
the use of specialized rescue equipment and techniques. Consider establishing
additional Rescue teams if the area of collapse is widespread and involves
numerous buildings.
G. Establish a transportation corridor. Command shall ensure roadways are clear in and
out of the collapse site so that apparatus and other heavy equipment and machinery
have access to the site. Consider establishing a liaison with the Police Department to
accomplish this function.
Phase III

Rescue Operations

Technical rescue operations shall be conducted under the direction of Rescue Sector by
trained Technical Rescue Technicians.

PAGE 4 of 7

I. RESCUE SECTOR
Rescue Sector responsibilities shall include the following:
•
•
•

Ensure that all personnel operating in Rescue Sector are accounted for and
wearing appropriate PPE.
Develop a rescue plan and a back-up plan.
Ensure the plan and a back-up plan, which include emergency procedures, are
communicated to all personnel operating on the incident.

II. THE RESCUE PLAN
Rescue operations should be conducted with as little risk to the rescuers as necessary
to affect the rescue. Low-risk operations may not always be possible but should be
considered first. The rescue plan shall be developed through consultation with Rescue
Sector, Safety, Command, and the Technical Advisor. The plan and a back-up plan,
which include emergency procedures, shall be communicated to all personnel operating
on the incident.
III. THE RESCUE
A. Remove surface victims. First responders should be assigned to remove victims and
the “walking wounded” from the surface of the collapse area. Rescuers shall use
extreme caution during the early stages of rescue operations due to significant
hazards which have not yet been identified. Following the removal of surface victims
and the “walking wounded”, all rescue personnel should be removed from the
collapse area and a personnel accountability report (PAR) shall be obtained. This will
allow for a re-grouping of rescue personnel and the implementation of a detailed
search and rescue plan to locate and remove any other victims from the collapse
area.
After surface victims and the “walking wounded” have been removed from the collapse
area, all non-TRT rescue personnel shall be removed from the collapse area and
Technical Rescue operations shall begin under the direction of Rescue Sector by trained
Technical Rescue Technicians.
B. Building Triage. Assign the Building Triage team to identify, select, and prioritize the
building(s) with the highest probability of success with respect to finding and rescuing
live victims. Additionally, the Building Triage team shall be responsible for using a
building marking system to indicate structural conditions and hazards present to
search and rescue personnel.
C. Locate victims. Following the structural and hazard assessment by the Building
Triage team, the Search team(s) shall be assigned to locate entrapped victims by
utilizing search canines (if available), and specialty search equipment such as search
cameras and acoustic listening devices. Search teams shall not enter buildings
which have been determined to be structurally unsafe until appropriate shoring and
stabilization measures have been taken.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

PAGE 5 of 7

D. Extricate entrapped victims. Once the Search team has located an entrapped victim,
the Rescue team(s) shall be responsible for utilizing their specialized rescue
equipment and techniques to extricate victims from the collapse area. The breaking
and breaching of walls, floors and roofs, will typically be associated with shoring and
other methods of stabilization which make these operations manpower and resource
intensive. Consider calling for additional resources and establishing a Resource
Sector. Rescue teams shall not enter buildings which have been determined to be
structurally unsafe until appropriate shoring and stabilization measures have been
taken.
E. Selected debris removal. If the Search team(s) has not been able to locate victims
through other methods, or if a victim location is known, either by credible witness or
search team verification, debris may be selectively removed to gain access to the
victim and/or otherwise unsearchable locations within the collapse area. Special care
must be exercised while removing debris to avoid a secondary collapse. Heavy
equipment such as a crane may be necessary to accomplish selected debris
removal. The selected debris removal process should be stopped periodically to
conduct search operations for additional victims. Once the debris has been removed
and search operations determine that there are no other victims in the area, rescue
personnel shall be accounted for and removed from the area.
F. General debris removal. Once it has been determined that no other live victims can
be located in the collapse area, a general debris removal operation may be started.
Removal crews shall be alert to possible deceased victims and/or victim body parts
and the coroner and/or other investigative personnel shall be notified to handle the
removal of the remains. As debris is removed, each load should be marked as to the
general location found and final location of the debris to aid in the investigative
process. Command may elect to turn general debris removal over to the responsible
party (RP) for final disposition of the building. If this option is exercised, the RP
should be informed as to the proper handling of debris for investigative purposes.
IV. TREATMENT
A. Conduct a primary survey upon reaching the victim.
B. Initiate C-spine precautions as soon as possible.
C. Conduct a secondary survey and correct any life threatening conditions.
D. Consider removing the victim from danger prior to providing definitive care.
E. Provide ALS level treatment and transportation to a hospital as indicated.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
A. Structural collapse incidents may present rescuers with a confined space situation.
Prior to entering any space, the atmosphere in that space must be monitored by a
qualified Hazardous Materials Technician with an appropriate air monitoring device
to determine if the space is safe to enter. If the atmosphere is determined to be
unsafe, it must be changed and made safe prior to any entry. If the atmosphere
cannot be changed, and entry must be made to retrieve a viable victim, rescue
personnel shall follow M.P. 204.08 Confined Space Rescue Operations to ensure the
safety of rescue personnel entering the space. Rescue Sector must be informed of
any confined space rescue operation and will keep Command informed of the
operation.
B. Rescue teams should consider the effects of lifting/moving heavy objects off victims
and have ALS level treatment available at the rescue site.

DISPATCH POLICY
The Phoenix Fire Department will respond to any EMERGENCY situation that threatens LIFE, SAFETY or
PROPERTY. In cases where the fire department is not the appropriate agency or not capable of delivering the
needed assistance, or if the situation is not a true emergency, an attempt will be made to place the caller in
contact with the appropriate provider. The fire department will dispatch the closest available unit(s) with the
required capabilities to control the emergency. The judgment of both Phoenix Fire Department Regional
Dispatch Center (PFDRDC) and emergency response personnel is an integral part of the decision making
process, taking into consideration both the information received and the potential that exists.
Timely response and effective management of EMS, rescue and fire control situations represent the most
immediate priorities of the fire department. Upon receipt of adequate or additional information (location,
telephone callback and nature of the emergency), Deployment will dispatch the appropriate assignment and
upgrade the response as necessary based on information received up to a Working First Alarm until command
is established upon the arrival of the first unit.
JURISDICTION
Emergency incidents within the Automatic Aid boundaries served by the PFDRDC will be dispatched without
regard to jurisdiction. Units will also be dispatched to borderline locations when Deployment personnel cannot
make accurate determination of the jurisdiction.
PFDRDC has enhanced mutual aid with Rural/Metro Fire Department (RMFD) within one (1) mile of the
borders of Scottsdale and Phoenix in the Northeast portion of the Valley. Rural/Metro units and Automatic Aid
Consortium units can be dispatched into these areas without prior approval when the CAD system recognizes
a RMFD unit is closer in these areas.
PFDRDC has enhanced mutual aid for requests by Gila River Indian Community Fire Department for incidents
that occur on I10 from Phoenix city limits to mile post 169; within two and one-half (2.5) miles from the border
of the Gila River Indian Community and the cities of Chandler and Phoenix in Maricopa County; within one (1)
mile of the border of the Gila River Indian Community, the City of Chandler, and the Sun Lakes Fire Districts in
Pinal County.
PFDRDC has one (1) way Automatic Aid onto Luke Air Force Base (LAFB). CAD has been programmed to
select LAFB units for any calls that fall within a five (5) mile radius of the base. CAD will also select the next
available unit to respond.
Calls for assistance from public or quasi-public agencies outside the Automatic Aid Consortium boundaries will
be dispatched as Mutual Aid incidents with the approval of the individual jurisdiction’s on-duty BC or the onduty Phoenix Fire Department Shift Commander if Phoenix resources are needed.
Calls for assistance from citizens outside the Automatic Aid Consortium boundaries will be transferred to the
appropriate agency. If that agency requests Mutual Aid assistance, PFDRDC will contact the appropriate
jurisdiction for approval of the Mutual Aid request and dispatch accordingly.

CALL ROUTING
Determination of the nature of the problem may indicate that a caller does not have an emergency that
requires a fire department response. The identification, prevention and reduction of unnecessary responses
are basic parts of the Deployment function. The call routing process must not delay response to valid
emergency incidents but should attempt to verify the nature of questionable calls. When a positive
determination of need for emergency response cannot be made THE FIRE DEPARTMENT POLICY IS TO
DISPATCH.
CALLTAKER
The primary responsibility of the Calltaker is to determine, without delay, the location, telephone callback and
nature of the emergency and to verify entry of the incident into the CAD system.
NATURE CODES
The Calltaker assigns a Nature Code based on information gathered from the caller. Once the Calltaker enters
the incident for dispatch, the CAD system selects available units by capability and proximity to fulfill the
response requirements of the assignment. Automatic Aid Consortium members have the ability to modify
response types for each Nature Code on file. The Phoenix Fire Department attempts to streamline this
process and works to maintain consistency however; the Phoenix Fire Department understands that some
variations are needed to meet the specific needs of the jurisdictions.
UNIT SELECTION
The CAD system recommends the closest, most appropriate unit/s/ for dispatch based on availability, current
location and capabilities. The CAD system combines this information with the response type.
A response type is assigned to each Nature Code. The response type identifies the requirements needed on
the assignment. Requirements can be identified by unit capability, such as engine or ladder, or by specific
unit, such as BC2. Requirements are also expressed as primary or secondary. A unit can fulfill only one
primary requirement. A unit can fulfill more than one secondary requirement.
When an incident is selected for dispatch, the CAD system builds an ordered unit consideration list. As a unit
is considered for dispatch, its capabilities are inventoried against the outstanding response requirements. If it
can satisfy any outstanding requirement it is added to the recommendation. The CAD system will continue to
add units to the recommendation until all response requirements have been satisfied or all units have been
exhausted. Some unit capabilities have distance limitations added to requirements. The system will not send
certain types of units if they are out of the predetermined response range.
RESPONSE ASSIGNMENTS
The Calltaker makes initial determination of the appropriate Nature Code based on information received from
the caller. Individual jurisdictions may customize the primary and secondary response requirements on a given
Nature Code. CAD will automatically dispatch the required units per Nature Code entered for each jurisdiction.
The RSPREQ command may be utilized to determine the specific primary and secondary response
requirements per Nature Code for an individual jurisdiction:
Format:
Example:

RSPREQ Nature Code, Jurisdiction Code (3 letters)

BLS Medical Calls
All medical calls are triaged using EMD protocols. On BLS responses the Company Officer will make a C2 or
C3 response decision and press the appropriate response on the MCT. If the response is modified and sent
as ALS when the caller provides additional information that meets the ALS criterion, the calls defaults to C3.
The ALS response criterion is different for each Nature Code.
Minor Medical Calls
The patient has to meet the following criteria; no loss of consciousness, peripheral injuries only, head/face;
arm: below elbow; leg: below knee, no trunk injuries, no impaled objects, no amputations, no severe bleeding.
Violent Medical Calls
The incident has been determined unsafe to respond directly to the scene. Units assigned to the incident shall
stage until the Police Department secures the scene.
Airport Incidents
The alert classifications of aircraft emergencies are distinguished by the Federal Aviation Administration to
describe an unsafe condition or situation involving an aircraft. The Fire Department Captain from Station 19
will identify the appropriate ARFF assignment to be dispatched on any aircraft emergency at Sky Harbor
Airport. The default assignment to Sky Harbor Airport is ARF2-1.
Fire Incidents
Incidents that require or potentially require water capabilities to extinguish a fire.
Fire Incidents (3-1's)
A 3-1 assignment will be dispatched for structure fires that do not indicate the need for a First Alarm
assignment.
Fire Incidents - First Alarms
A First Alarm will be dispatched for structure fires when reports indicate this level of resource are needed.
This may be based on reports that indicate an actual or potential situation. A First Alarm may be dispatched
for other types of incidents at the discretion of Dispatch personnel.
Brush Fires
Brush assignments will be dispatched for reported vegetation fires. A Still Brush assignment will be dispatched
for vegetation fires that are small in nature. A Brush assignment will be dispatched for vegetation fires that are
serious in nature. A First Alarm Brush assignment will be dispatched for vegetation fires that are and/or have
the potential to be a major situation requiring this level of resources.
Hazardous Materials
Hazardous Materials assignments will be dispatched for incidents reported to involve hazardous materials.
Hazardous Materials situations MAY include fire, spills, transportation accidents, chemical reactions,
explosions and/or similar events. Hazards may include toxicity, flammability, radiological hazards, chemical
reactions and/or combinations of factors.

Hazardous Materials cont’d
A HAZ assignment will be dispatched on calls that involve hazardous materials of a minor nature. A HAZ2-1
assignment should be dispatched on most situations involving leaks or spills of hazardous materials. This
includes situations that appear to be manageable and do not create a major risk to the public by virtue of
location, amount or type of hazard. A HAZ1A assignment should be dispatched for incidents that indicate a
major potential danger by virtue of materials involved, quantities, location, fire or explosion danger and/or
number of people exposed.
Technical Rescue
Incidents that may require specialized equipment and training to extricate the patient(s). These incidents
include confined space rescue, trench rescue, high angle or rope rescue, water rescue, structural collapse,
mountain and tree rescues.
Service Calls and Other Miscellaneous Incidents
Service Calls will also be dispatched for non-emergency situations. Deployment will select the appropriate
Nature Code that best describes the situation. Some service calls require the Calltaker to determine a C2
or C3 response.
SUPPLEMENTAL DISPATCH
Depending on the resources required additional units may be dispatched to an incident in several methods.
Units can be Special Called, an assignment can be Balanced or a Greater Alarm can be requested.
Special Call
A Special Call is a request for the dispatch of any combination of additional unit types, unit capabilities or
specific units. The requestor must specify the desired quantity of unit types or capabilities or the specific units
desired.
When formulating a recommendation for a special call, no consideration is given to the units already assigned
to the incident. All response requirements for the special call request are satisfied by the recommendation of
additional units.
Balance of Assignment
A balance of assignment is a request for the dispatch of the additional units necessary to upgrade the
response type. Either the desired response type or a specific Nature Code must be specified. If a Nature
Code is specified, the CAD system will determine the response type based on the specified Nature Code and
the jurisdiction in which the incident is located.
When formulating a recommendation for a Balance of an assignment, the CAD system first determines which
response requirements for the new response type are satisfied by the units that are already assigned to the
incident. The CAD system then recommends additional units to satisfy any outstanding response requirement.
Greater Alarm
A Greater Alarm is a request for the dispatch of additional units using predefined requirement sets. A Greater
Alarm request requires both a Greater Alarm Type and the Response Level.

Greater Alarm cont’d
When formulating a recommendation for a Greater Alarm, no consideration is given to the units already
assigned to the incident. The Response Level indicated satisfies all response requirements for the Greater
Alarm. Assignments should be balanced up to and including a Working First Alarm. When an assignment is
Balanced, the system takes into consideration the units currently assigned to the incident. Therefore, an
incident can go from a single engine response, such as a tree fire and be Balanced to a Working First Alarm
allowing the system to fulfill all requirements necessary for the Working First Alarm. This however does not
occur for Greater Alarms. A 3-1 assignment that needs the resources of a Greater Alarm must first be
Balanced to a Working Fire Alarm then the Greater Alarm request must be generated.
Response Levels do not have to be equivalent to Alarm Levels, however, often times they are. The response
level requested for a Greater Alarm request should reflect the level of resources required, not necessarily the
next alarm level.
Example:

An incident may be a Third Alarm Structure and may require the components of a Hazardous
Assignment. The assumption is to ask for a Fourth Alarm Hazardous. If, however, a Fourth Alarm
Hazardous were requested, no Hazardous Materials capabilities would be added to the
assignment. At this point, a Second Alarm Hazardous must be requested.

Specific Types of Second Alarms
Second Alarms are dispatched at the request of command, when the need is indicated. Command should ask
for the specific type alarm needed to continue managing the incident: If a First Alarm Brush is being used and
Command wants to provide relief for crews, Command should call for a Second Alarm Rehab.
The following are valid codes for Greater Alarms:
BRUSH
HAZMAT
HIRISE
MED
REHAB
RESCUE
STRUCT
STRMED

BRUSH ASSIGNMENT
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ASSIGNMENT
HIRISE ASSIGNMENT
MEDICAL ASSIGNMENT
REHAB ASSIGNMENT
RESCUE ASSIGNMENT
STRUCTURAL ASSIGNMENT
STRUCTURAL/MED

Greater Alarms
Third Alarms and greater still require a specific type of alarm to be requested; however the capabilities
recommended will be generic and are the same for each Greater Alarms up to a Ninth Alarm.
DISPATCH CHANNEL 1
The Channel 1 dispatcher is responsible for reviewing the unit/s/ suggested for dispatch by the CAD system.
The dispatcher may modify the unit selection based on additional information or circumstantial factors.
The dispatcher transmits the call to the assigned units by depressing the DISPATCH button, sending the
information to the Fire Station Packages and Mobile Computer Terminals (MCTs).

Normal Dispatch
The voice dispatch message is broadcast over Fire Channel 1 giving:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Dispatch Tone
Companies Assigned
Tactical Radio Channel
Type and/or Nature of Incident
Location
Companies Assigned
Tactical Radio Channel

DURING PERIODS OF HIGH ACTIVITY THE DISPATCH MESSAGE MAY BE MODIFIED TO ADVISE UNITS
TO CHECK MCT's FOR DISPATCH.
Immediate Dispatch
Specific high priority Nature Codes are flagged for Immediate Dispatch upon incident entry. Additionally,
Calltakers have the ability to cause any incident to be dispatched immediately upon entry in the CAD system.
During an Immediate Dispatch the station terminals and MCT's will receive the dispatch information as soon as
the Calltaker enters the call. The Voice Dispatch will occur when the call is processed through Channel 1. The
time elapsing between Station Alerting and Voice Dispatch will depend upon the level of activity at the dispatch
position.
Working Incident Notifications
Deployment will sound the ALL CALL tone and make a general announcement over Dispatch Channel 1 of the
following incidents:
• Working First Alarm fires
• Greater Alarms
• At the discretion of the on-duty Deployment BC and/or Supervisor
Change of Status
All companies are in either in an AVAILABLE or UNAVAILABLE status at all times. The status refers to the
company's availability to accept a dispatch. Units assigned to an incident are considered UNAVAILABLE until
released. The exception to this is during AOI calls; see ‘Responding’ section for further details.
Units that are Available on Radio (AOR) or Available Out of Vehicle (AOV) shall monitor Channel 1.
Units changing their status to UNAVAILABLE should report to Deployment by radio on Tactical Channel 2 or
telephone the reason and the length of time they will be unavailable. When becoming available again, units
are responsible to report this status change to Deployment.
It is important that company officers contact Deployment prior to putting their unit unavailable. Deployment will
determine if any priority needs exist which may require the unit to stay in service.
MOVE-UP POLICY
The on-duty Deployment Supervisor/Battalion Chief is responsible for relocating units as necessary to maintain
the best available resource coverage for the entire dispatch jurisdictional coverage area. This responsibility
includes the authority to request companies from the Automatic Aid Consortium and to control or cancel
scheduled and non-scheduled non-emergency activities. NOTE: Members assigned to Adaptive Response
units should refer to M.P. 205.09 Adaptive Response Units.

MOVE-UP POLICY cont’d
Moved-up companies retain their normal identity ("Engine 14 out of Station 30").
The need for move-up companies will be evaluated whenever:
•
•
•
•
•
•

A working fire is declared.
Three (3) or more units are committed to an incident in an outlying area.
Greater Alarms are dispatched.
Simultaneous working incidents occur in one area of the City.
Coverage in an area is compromised.
Two (2) or more adjacent first due areas will be uncovered for more than 30 minutes.

Move-ups will be C2 unless advised to respond C3 due to a critical gap in coverage.
If overall coverage in the City of Phoenix falls below 12 engine companies and three (3) ladder companies,
Deployment will immediately notify the South Shift Commander who has the responsibility to authorize the
recall of off duty personnel to staff reserve companies if necessary.
TACTICAL RADIO OPERATOR (TRO)
The TRO handles all communications between units assigned to an incident and Deployment on the assigned
Tactical Channel. All units responding to an incident shall switch to the assigned channel immediately after
dispatch.
Self Dispatch
Units may add themselves to an incident by an AU function on their MCT. Companies adding on to an
assignment must advise the TRO on the assigned Tactical Channel if they are substituting for another unit or
responding in addition to the original assignment. The TRO will cancel the original unit dispatched if the
substituting unit is closer to the scene.
The TRO will advise the Command Officer of units responding in addition to the dispatched assignment. The
updated dispatch message will be transmitted to all responding units via MCT.
Acknowledgement
All units responding to an incident shall acknowledge dispatch by radio on the assigned tactical channel or by
Mobile Computer Terminal (MCT).
If Deployment does not receive an acknowledgment within one (1) minute, the TRO will request
acknowledgment by radio on all channels and via MCT.
Deployment will send a cover assignment if no reply is received within a two (2) minute timeframe.
Deployment will continue to attempt to make contact with the original company while the cover unit is
responding. If unable to contact the original unit, the company will be placed unavailable and the appropriate
Battalion Chief notified of the circumstances.

Responding
All fire and ALS EMS responses will be C3 unless otherwise indicated by Deployment or Command. Units
responding to calls on the freeways will proceed C2. BLS Nature Codes will be dispatched without a C2 or C3
response flag. The company officer will make the determination to respond after reviewing the dispatch
information. Minor medical incidents and some service calls will be dispatched C2/Available on Incident (AOI).
The AOI feature allows a company assigned to a low priority incident to be preempted for a higher priority call if
they are the closest unit. This occurs automatically on pre-identified AOI type calls and when a unit is in a
responding mode.
If the company officer makes the decision to respond C2 on a C3 call, he/she must advise his/her TRO or
press C2 on his/her MCT and send. Similarly, if the company officer makes the decision to respond C3 on a
C2 call, he/she must advise his/her TRO or press C3 on his/her MCT and send.
A unit dispatched on a C2 AOI call will automatically become AOI after acknowledging response to the initial
call. After acknowledgement they will remain AOI until they arrive on the scene. If a unit is responding longer
than ten (10) minutes on an AOI call, CAD will automatically place the unit in the Unavailable On Incident (UOI)
status, and they will no longer be considered for preemption. Once a unit places themselves on-scene of an
incident, they are no longer considered available for dispatches until they return to an available status.
•

If a company officer determines they do not want to be AOI while responding, they may indicate they
are traveling C3 to the incident via radio or MCT. If the company officer determines they do not want to
be AOI while responding C2 to the incident, they may use the MCT command UOI. This command will
show the unit responding C2 however the unit will not be available for preemption.

•

Once a company arrives on-scene of an incident and have determined they could leave the call
promptly to take another call, they can place themselves AOI again either via radio or MCT.

While responding, companies may communicate with one another if radio traffic permits. Effective
communications during this period can set the stage for effective action and improve the overall rescue and fire
attack effort. Factors such as occupancy hazards, access, traffic conditions and response routes may be
communicated.
Company officers should review tactical information on their MCT, map books and any pre-fire planning
information carried on the vehicle for specific tactical information. Subsequent arriving units should monitor
radio traffic to be fully informed of the situation based on reports of the first arriving units.
Additional Information / Subsequent Calls
The TRO will relay any additional information gained from subsequent calls as soon as possible. Additional
information and updates will be transmitted to the MCTs of all responding units.
Companies needing specific additional information shall request it from the TRO.

On-scene Reports
The first fire department member or unit to arrive at the scene of a multiple unit response shall assume
command of the incident*. The initial Incident Commander shall remain in Command until Command is
transferred or the incident is stabilized and Command is terminated.
•

One or two company responses that are not going to escalate beyond the commitment of these
companies do not require the first arriving unit or officer to assume Command. The first arriving unit or
officer will, however remain responsible for any needed Command functions. Examples would include:
 Single unit response Check Welfare
 Check Hazard
 Any EMS call requiring only one or two companies

The first arriving fire department unit initiates the command process by giving an initial radio report.
The standard Initial Radio Report includes:
On-Scene Report
1. Clear alarm.
2. Unit designation/on the scene.
3. Building/area description.
Occupancy
Size (large, medium, small)
Height (assumed 1 story unless reported otherwise)
4. Obvious problem/conditions.

Command
Once command has been established, all routine communication between Deployment and an incident will be
directed through Command.
Progress Reports
During active firefighting operations, Command will provide Deployment with regular progress reports or
whenever significant tactical plans are changed or unusual situations are encountered. The first progress
report should be given after initial action has been implemented and should include the correct address and an
improved description of the building and fire conditions if the arrival report was incomplete. This assists
Deployment in making move-up decisions. The TRO will repeat significant facts from all progress reports for
the information of monitoring units and document in the incident history.
Working Fire
The term Working Fire indicates a situation that will require the commitment of all responding companies. This
report advises Deployment that the companies will be engaged in tactical activities and will be held at the
scene for an extended period of time.
When notified of a Working 3-1, Deployment will:
1. Dispatch a Working Fire assignment (WF)
2. Address the need for a Fire Investigator.
3. Dispatch PD for traffic and crowd control.
4. Dispatch appropriate gas and electric companies.
5. Change the status to a Working Fire, which starts elapsed time notifications.
6. Make move-ups to affected area
7. Document progress reports, sectors, assignments, emergency traffic, and elapsed time notifications
and append additional information provided from Deployment members in the Incident History.
When notified of a Working First Alarm, Deployment will:
1. Dispatch a Working Fire assignment (WF1A)
2. Isolate tactical channel
3. Dispatch a Fire Investigator
4. Dispatch PD for traffic and crowd control
5. Dispatch gas and electric companies
6. Make move-ups to affected area
7. Document progress reports, Sectors/Divisions/Groups, assignments, emergency traffic, and elapsed
time notifications and append additional information provided from Deployment members in the Incident
History.
8. Be prepared to assign a TRO to monitor/work Staging and Safety Sectors/Divisions channels.
9. Be prepared to dispatch further assistance.
10. Be prepared to dispatch any special agencies or equipment when the need is indicated.
11. Make notifications to pertinent personnel.
Deployment will monitor radio traffic on all incidents to anticipate the needs of Command.
Any fire at a school facility requires the State Fire Marshall to be contacted. The on-duty State Fire Marshall
will use his/her discretion as to response.

Staging
Units arriving in Staging will depress the "STG" key on their MCT. If assigned to a sector or task on the
fireground the "ON-SCENE" key shall be depressed.
Units arriving in Level I Staging will report their identity and direction from the scene on the assigned Tactical
Channel.
Upon the balance of a working Second Alarm assignment, Level II Staging will be identified by Command.
Deployment will announce Level II staging location and the staging channel when the additional units are
dispatched. Units responding should direct any staging inquiries to the Staging channel, rather than the
Tactical channel assigned to the incident. Typically Staging will be assigned to Channel 2. The driver of the
CV will coordinate information on the Staging channel until an officer assumes the position of the Staging
Officer. Units arriving at the Level II Staging Area will report in person to the Staging Officer. The Staging
Officer will manage all radio communications to and from the Staging Area.
Incident Status & Milestones
The following are the different incident status changes that need to be indicated: Working Fire (WF), Working
Haz Mat (WHZ), Working Technical Rescue (WTR), Code (CO), or Major Medical (MM). When one (1) of
these incidents are identified by command, the TRO will enter a specific command. For Working Fire and
Working Haz Mat incidents, this change will prompt ELAPSED TIME NOTIFICATIONS. The system will
generate an elapsed time notification every five (5) minutes until the incident is placed Under Control. The
TRO will verbally provide command with elapsed time notifications until the situation is declared under control
or Command requests to discontinue notifications. Elapsed Time Notifications will also be documented in the
Incident History.
The following are the definitions of the Incident Milestones:
906: Fire unit/s/ need immediate police department assistance.
All Clear (AC): Can be used on a fire or medical incident. On fire calls an All Clear indicates the fire
building and all exposures have been searched and all civilians evacuated. In the case of a building that
is well involved in fire, the All Clear may be delayed and not come until the fire is out. For medical calls, it
indicates the patient has been extricated. It is used most commonly when patients have been trapped as
a result of an automobile accident or during a water or mountain rescue when the patient has been
removed from the endangered area.
CO Below 50ppm (CO): Level of carbon monoxide is below 50 parts per million, units may operate
without SCBA protection.
Command Terminated (CT): There is no longer a single person in charge of the incident.
Communications can be held with anyone still on the scene.
Command Terminated (XCM) – Also referred to as Cancel Command. There is no longer a single person
in charge of the incident. This milestone is used after CT and removed the Command designator from the
unit.
Defensive (DEF): Units operating in the defensive strategy.
Emergency Traffic (ETT): Emergency Traffic has been declared on an incident

RETURNING COMPANIES
Only Command can release companies assigned to an incident. Command will indicate the units to "HOLD" at
the scene, report the nature of the actual situation found and release the remainder of the assignment. The
TRO will repeat this report from Command and document the “HOLD” command in the incident history.
Returning units will be responsible for placing their unit in an AOR status when available.
SECTORS/DIVISIONS/GROUPS
NOTE: Sectors may be assigned by their geographic location (North Sector) or function (Ventilation Sector).
Divisions are assigned by their geographic location (North Division). Groups are assigned by their function
(Ventilation Group). For the remainder of this MP we will refer to Sectors with the understanding that either
Divisions or Groups may be used where appropriate.
Sector Officers should use face-to-face communications with assigned companies as much as possible, but
should keep Command informed of progress via radio on any problems encountered and significant progress.
Command may assign Sector Officer’s FITs to a designated Safety Channel when desired to enhance overall
scene safety.
CAD SECTOR COMMANDS
The TRO should ensure that each unit that is assigned to a Sector is documented using the Sector
Commands. The TRO will enter the appropriate command to designate a Sector Officer (SECTO), a Sector
Member (SECTM) or to remove a unit from a sector (SECTX). Using these commands allows both the TRO
and Incident Commander to track the assignment of units during the incident. The TRO can designate a sector
ID of up to six (6) alphanumeric characters.
Example: SECTO E3 INTER or SECTM E2 INTER
STAFF
Staff members with fireground responsibilities will respond to Greater Alarms for assistance with various sector
functions. Staff members will report in person to the Command Post and will automatically assume sector
duties in their area of responsibility unless ordered otherwise.
Communications from staff personnel should be with command as much as possible; however, there will be
situations that require direct communications with sector officers. Staff communications should be face to face
as much as possible.
An isolated Tactical Channel will be assigned by Deployment for each incident where applicable. Command
may also request a "Clear Channel" for a working incident. When requested, Deployment will direct units on
other incidents to an alternate Tactical Channel.

ORDER MODEL
Radio communications will be regulated by the following order model guidelines.
1.
2.
3.
4.

Sender will give unit ID and call the receiver by their unit ID.
Receiver will give their ID to indicate they are ready to receive.
Sender will then extend message, order, etc.
Receiver will give ID and acknowledge receipt of message. A brief restatement is the best
acknowledgment.
5. Deployment will acknowledge all communications directed to it by a brief restatement of the message,
with particular attention given to repeating on the scene, size-up and progress reports, recall reports,
requests for additional resource and all Incident Status changes and milestones.
MAY DAY
"May Day" is a term to be used only in the event of a lost or trapped firefighter. (See “May Day”
Communications for further details.) A well-defined communications structure is essential in any rescue
operation. Deployment will play a crucial role in ensuring the effective rescue of firefighters.
EMERGENCY TRAFFIC
The term ‘Emergency Traffic’ will be utilized by any unit encountering an immediately perilous situation and will
receive the highest communications priority from Deployment, Command and all operating units. Units may
initiate emergency communications by depressing the red emergency button on their portable radio, MCT, or
by verbally contacting Deployment.
EXAMPLE: ‘L11 to Alarm with Emergency Traffic’. Deployment will immediately activate the Emergency
Traffic tone. The unit will transmit his/her message. Deployment will repeat message one (1)
time and document in the Incident History.
If Deployment does not acknowledge Emergency Traffic the unit should then establish contact with Command
and transmit the emergency message. Command will then re-initiate the Emergency Traffic sequence with
Deployment.
WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE AIR BELONGS TO ANY UNIT WITH ‘EMERGENCY TRAFFIC’
UNIT DESIGNATION
For radio communications, the following designations will be recognized as standard:

RADIO CODE
"Plain language" radio messages should be used in preference to numerical codes to facilitate understanding.
There is no official Phoenix Fire Department radio code. This is also in compliance with NIMS.
The following code messages (from the Police radio code) may be used in sensitive situations, when a plain
language message could cause a problem at the scene:
261
901-H
906
961
962
963

Rape
Dead body
Need Police assistance IMMEDIATELY
Vehicle accident, no injuries
Vehicle accident, with injuries
Vehicle accident with fatality

RADIO PROCEDURE
Short-specific
Before transmitting know what you are going to say. Choose precise terms to communicate the desired
message as clearly and briefly as possible without wasting airtime.
Task Oriented/Company Oriented
Command’s orders to operating companies should indicate a specific task assigned to the company. They
should be of a magnitude reasonably performed by a single company alone or in concert with other
companies.
Indicate Objective
In addition to being task and company oriented, assignments should indicate an objective to the action. The
company should know exactly where to go, to whom to report, what is the task and what is the objective of the
task. Orders should tell what to do - not how to do it (unless Command wants something specific).
Clear Tone/Self Control Effective Rate
Speak clearly at a practiced rate. Not too fast and not too slow. Control your emotions and excitement
deliberately. If you do not consciously control your voice, it will become garbled under stress.
Well Timed/Spaced
Prioritize your messages. Do not use valuable airtime with unimportant messages and insignificant details.
Maintain an awareness of the overall situation and your role in it.
Do not interrupt conversations unless you have Emergency Traffic. Listen before transmitting and wait until a
message transaction has been completed.
Pause between consecutive messages. This will make it clear when one message has been completed and
another started. It also allows other units to break in with urgent/emergent traffic if applicable.

The Phoenix Fire Department E.M.S. Dispatch Policy continues to revolve around an adequate, early
and pessimistic response of the closest units required to handle a particular medical emergency.
The following medical emergencies will receive a dispatch of the closest fire suppression unit backed
up by a paramedic unit. When a four-person paramedic unit is the closest unit, the dispatch of an

The Dispatch Center will dispatch an assignment to medical incidents according to the reported scale and
severity of the situation. The assignment will be upgraded by Command, as necessary, based on the
actual situation encountered.
Dispatch is responsible for notifying and activating other agencies, including hospitals, to provide needed
support for management of the incident. The following should be used as guidelines:
2-1 MEDICAL ASSIGNMENT
1. Determine approximate number and triage classification of patients.
2. Contact Level 1 and 2 hospitals when requested by Command. Advise hospitals of situation,
location, and number of patients involved. Determine current ability to receive patients.
3. Communicate hospital availability information to Command or Transportation Sector.
4. Advise notified hospitals when incident is terminated if they are not receiving any patients.
1ST ALARM--MEDICAL
1. Determine approximate number and triage classification of patients.
2. Place private medical helicopters and DPS Ranger on stand-by.
3. Contact Level 1 hospitals when requested by Command. Advise hospitals of situation, location,
and number of patients involved. Determine current ability to receive patients.
4. Communicate hospital availability to Command or Transportation Sector.
5. Dispatch rescues and helicopters as requested by Command.
6. Advise notified hospitals when incident is terminated if they are not receiving patients.
GREATER ALARM -- MEDICAL
Begin full-scale notification procedure. Continue until reports indicate situation has been stabilized.
NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES FOR MEDICAL DISASTER
This procedure applies to large scale mass casualty medical situations:
A. Rescues
1. Dispatch all available Fire Department rescues to Staging Area. Location shall be designated by
Command.
2. Dispatch private ambulance companies as needed.
3. Determine ETA and number of Rescues available.
4. Advise Command of number of Rescues responding.
5. Activate all reserve Fire Department Rescues.

B. Helicopters
1. Place private medical helicopters and DPS Ranger on stand-by. Determine number and availability
to respond.
2. Dispatch as requested by Command.
3. Advise helicopter of radio channel for Landing Zone coordination.
C. Hospitals
1. Advise hospitals and emergency centers of situation, location and approximate number of patients
involved. Ask hospitals to determine how many patients they can handle and to stand-by for call
back. Advise them not to call the Dispatch Center.
2. Call all Level 1 hospitals and specialty hospitals first. Call Level 2 facilities according to geographic
proximity to scene.
3. Call back medical facilities to determine ability to receive patients. Advise Transportation Sector
when ready to receive information.
4. Level 1 and 2 medical facilities should be notified according to their specific categories as they
relate to the incident (i.e., trauma, burns, pediatric, poisoning, etc.).
5. When Transportation Sector advises that all patients have been transported, confirm number of
patients sent to each hospital. Advise each notified hospital of total patients transported or enroute,
including those which will not receive any patients. Advise hospitals that no more patients are
expected to be transported.
D. City Buses
Ask Command if buses are needed. Dispatch Phoenix Transit buses to the Level 2 staging area.
NOTE: Phoenix Transit buses are radio dispatched.

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to define the responsibilities of the Dispatch employees in providing
Rescues in the fifteen communities within the Phoenix Regional Dispatch jurisdiction.
DEFINITION
A Rescue is a vehicle that transports medical patients to a hospital. The Regional Dispatch Center
uses both fire department Rescues and Ambulances owned by private companies. All fire department
Rescues are staffed with a minimum of two fire fighters, which are at least EMT certified or EMT-P
(paramedics). The private owned ambulances are also staffed with two EMTs or paramedics, however,
they are not fire fighters.

Some of the cities in the dispatch jurisdiction use fire department Rescues and some contract with
private companies. Phoenix, Sun Lakes, Sun City West and Daisy Mountain operate fire department
Rescues. Glendale, Tempe, Peoria, Sun City, Youngtown, Tolleson, Laveen, Avondale, Guadalupe, El
Mirage, and Surprise contract with private companies.
DISPATCH POLICIES
In all cities, except for Phoenix, a Rescue or Ambulance is dispatched on all medical calls, BLS or ALS.
In the city of Phoenix, a Rescue is dispatched initially on the following calls: gunshot wound, stabbing,
auto accident that appears serious, car/pedestrian accident , code and drowning. A Rescue will be
dispatched at the request of a field unit at any time.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

RESCUE COMMUNICATIONS
M.P. 205.04

03/03-R

Page 2 of 6

Private Transportation Only
A fire department Rescue will be dispatched to transport a patient in stable condition (A stable condition
will be defined as: State of health in which the prognosis indicates little, if any, immediate change.) in a
"non-emergency" situation ONLY if all private ambulance companies refuse to accept the call for
transportation. A fire company and fire department Rescue will respond Code 2 to evaluate and
transport the patient.
The Certificate of Need (C.O.N.) prohibits our Rescues from providing service outside of the City of
Phoenix. The Phoenix Fire Department is providing the following guidelines to other valley departments
when requesting a PFD Rescue.
Requests for emergency transportation must meet the following criteria prior to any response by a
Phoenix Rescue:
•

First, request to that city current C.O.N. holder

•

Second, request to an air transport C.O.N. holder*

•

Third, request to Phoenix Fire Department**

*If transport via helicopter is not practical (combative patients, hazardous materials exposures, etc.) or
will cause a greater delay in transport of a critically ill or injured person, a Phoenix Fire Department
Rescue will respond if requested.
**Patient must be unstable or patient condition would worsen as a result of an extended wait for an
ambulance.
These guidelines will insure that when the need for our assistance is critical to patient care a Phoenix
Rescue response can be justified.
Calls Received from Private Ambulance Companies
A fire department Rescue will not be dispatched on an emergency call when a private ambulance is
responding. If the patient needs "emergency" transportation, the unit on the scene will advise Dispatch
to check on the ETA for the private ambulance. If the response time of the private ambulance company
is excessive, Dispatch will send a fire department Rescue if the above guidelines have been met and
advise the private ambulance company of the situation.

Requests from Governmental Agencies
When a governmental agency (Phoenix Police Department, Arizona DPS, MCSO, etc.) requests a fire
department Rescue, Dispatch will determine the nature of the request. If the "emergency" meets the
criteria for fire department response, the appropriate assignment will be dispatched with a Rescue. If
the request is of a "non-emergency" nature the agency will be routed to the appropriate agency to
assist them (i.e., private ambulance company, LARC, taxi, etc.).
Requests from Medical Care Facilities
When a medical care facility (i.e., doctor's office, urgent care center, hospital, etc.) requests a fire
department Rescue, Dispatch will determine the nature of the emergency. If the nature of the call is
determined to be "non-emergency", the caller will be routed to the appropriate provider (i.e., private
ambulance company, helicopter, etc.). If the nature is "emergency," the fire department will respond
and transport sick or injured patients from care facilities under the following conditions:
1. An unstable patient necessitating emergency pre-hospital assistance and transfer to the closest
hospital.
2. When there are no other transportation options available to a stable patient.
NOTE:

If the fire department units respond to a medical care facility and find a patient in a stable
condition under the care of a medical professional, all efforts will be made to contact a
private provider for transportation instead of a fire department Rescue.

Extended Response Time
When a fire department Rescue is responding to an "emergency" and will have a response time
exceeding 20 minutes, the Dispatcher will contact the private ambulance companies and determine if
they have a closer unit. If a closer private unit can accept the call, the fire department Rescue will be
canceled.
All Fire Department Rescues are Unavailable
If all fire department Rescues are unavailable, Dispatch will contact authorized private ambulance
companies to respond on calls with the fire department units. If a fire department Rescue becomes
available to respond on the call and is closer to the call than the dispatched private ambulance, the
private ambulance will be canceled and the fire department Rescue will respond.
Dispatch will make every effort to send a fire department Rescue to emergencies within the City of
Phoenix.

Fire Department Rescue Status
Dispatch will make every effort to monitor Rescue status. It is the responsibility of the Rescue crew to
advise Dispatch of any status change.
Rescue at Hospital:
When a Rescue has been at the hospital for approximately 20 minutes, the Channel 1
operator will make contact with them to confirm their status and determine when they expect
to go available.
Unavailable Status:
Any time a fire department Rescue goes unavailable an MCT message will be sent to
Dispatch in the following format:
TO/DS2 SUPV/ UNAV to . . . . . (i.e., FUEL, PICK-UP EQUIP, ETC.)
When returning to first due area, Rescues should go available when within 10 minutes
driving time to quarters. Units shall monitor Channel 1 traffic while en-route to their first due
area for incidents for which they may be the closest response unit.
Returning Paramedic Back to Fire Stations:
The Rescue should NOT go unavailable when returning paramedics back to their fire
station.
Rescue Status Conditions
Rescue Status 2 and Status 3 were designed to enhance the emergency transportation service. The
Status reflects a shortage of Rescue capability in a specific geographic area or the entire city. During
Rescue Status 2 or 3, Rescues should expedite hospital turnarounds and advise Dispatch of
anticipated availability.
The Dispatch Captain, Supervisor, and the Channel 1 operator will jointly monitor all Rescue status.
When they determine that either a Status 2 or 3 need to be declared, the Channel 1 operator will make
the announcement. Each TRO will also make the same announcement on their tactical channels. The
Supervisor will fill out the Rescue status form and forward it to ETS.

Rescue Status 2:
Status 2 indicates that there is a Rescue shortage in a particular area of the city. The city is divided
into the following areas:
Central

-

I-17 to 24th St, Bethany to I-10

North

-

North of Bethany

South

-

South of I-10

West

-

West of I-17

East

-

East of 24th St.

Rescue Status 3:
Status 3 is an urgent message for ALL Rescues to return to service as quickly as possible. This level
of notification shall be treated as a serious situation requiring immediate response. This level is
reserved when there are less than three Rescues available in the entire city.
When expediting turnarounds, paperwork should be completed at a later time, over the phone or in
person, as the circumstances dictate.
Termination of Rescue Status 3:
Dispatch will announce on Channel 1 and all Tactical channels when Rescue Status 3 is terminated
and resume normal operating conditions when additional units are no longer required.
Rescue Use of MCT's
Fire department Rescues will place themselves "responding", "on the scene", "leaving the scene", and
"at the hospital" via MCT functions. It is imperative that the Rescue attendant checks the MCT for any
"NOACK" for these three MCT transmissions. If a "NOACK" appears, use the radio and report
"responding", "on the scene", "leaving the scene" and "at the hospital" on the assigned Tactical Radio
Channel. The TRO will acknowledge the radio transmission and enter it into the incident history.
Add Unit (AU) to a Medical Incident:
Fire department Rescues should contact the Channel 1 operator and indicate they are available to take
a call if they are a closer Rescue. If Dispatch advises the unit to respond, the Rescue must first go
available (AOR) from any previous call and add unit (AU) to the new call. Rescues should also utilize
the MCT to add unit (AU) when coming out of a hospital to respond to a call. DO NOT ADD
YOURSELF TO THE CALL UNTIL ACTUALLY RESPONDING.
NOTE:

Dispatch will add you to the call if you make a request via radio.

Maximum Number of Rescues Scheduled Out-of-Service:
Only two Rescues will be allowed out-of-service at one time for scheduled activities such as P.M.,
training, physicals, etc.
Fire department Rescues going out-of-service for preventive maintenance shall contact Dispatch for
authorization before placing themselves unavailable. If at all possible, scheduling of Rescue P.M.'s
should not occur during the hours of high activity (i.e., 0700 to 0900 and 1500 to 1800).
Part-Time Rescues:
Part-time Rescues ready to go in service at scheduled shift time should contact Dispatch at 2626595 to indicate they are ready to go in service and use the MCT to place the Rescue Available in
Quarters (AIQ).
Part-time Rescues should call the Dispatch Captain/Supervisor at their scheduled off duty time to
confirm it is appropriate to take the Rescue out of service. If it is determined necessary to hold them
over, the Rescue personnel will be advised at the time to holdover and the approximate time limit of
holdover.
At NO time should a Rescue go out of service for the shift by using the MCT without checking with
Dispatch.

Page 1 of 3

PURPOSE
To establish a process for involved facilities and agencies to effectively manage seasonal emergency
department overloads. This procedure supports the Central Region Coordinating System Diversion
Protocol.
GOAL
The rapid delivery of definitive medical care through effective management of fire department
rescues/ambulance transportation during implementation of regional guidelines on pre-hospital
diversion. (Procedure 9701).
DEFINITIONS
Diversion/Bypass are official terms used in AEMS policies to route 911 system patients away from a
facility that is saturated or overcrowded to the point that emergency department resources are
unavailable. Critical patients with uncontrollable medical problems will always by triaged to the
closest appropriate emergency department.
a.

Emergency medical condition means a medical condition manifesting itself through
presentation of acute symptoms with sufficient serverity (including severe pain), such
that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result
in the following:
1.
2.
3.

Placing the patient’s health in serious jeopardy.
Serious impairment of bodily function.
Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.

b.

Uncontrollable medical problems shall be defined as those pertaining to the inability to
provide an adequate airway or ventilation, lack of a palpable pulse, in the non-traumatic
patient.

c.

Neighboring facilities shall be defined as emergency departments or trauma services
located in proximate geographic areas. This term applies to the cooperative effort of
notification of saturation or disaster status and assuring availability of emergency care for
patients prior to activation of any pre-hospital diversion.

d.

Fully committed resources means the health care professionals at an emergency
department or trauma service are at maximum capacity providing treatment to acutely ill
or injured patients and are temporarily unable to provide “safe, appropriate, and timely”
medical care to patients with an emergency medical condition.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

HOSPITAL DIVERSION MANAGEMENT PLAN
M.P. 205.04A

07/99-N

Page 2 of 3

Informal diversion shall be defined as a situation during which a pre-hospital care
provider or a pre-hospital communication center contacts a facility that has not previously
proclaimed a pre-hospital diversion and that care provider or communication center is
instructed to divert a patient “or patients” to another facility.

DIVERSION CATEGORIES
The following are acceptable pre-hospital diversion categories. The declaration of diversion in one
category does not place a facility on diversion in any other category.
a.

Emergency department saturation: An emergency department has “fully committed its
resources” and is not available for any additional incoming patients with an “emergency
medical condition.” They shall be listed as “open or closed” by the Dispatch Center.

b.

Trauma service saturation: A trauma service has “fully committed its resources” and is
not available for additional incoming Level One trauma. A trauma service shall be
presented as “open or closed” by the Dispatch Center for those providers.

c.

Facility internal disaster/equipment failure: Through policy and procedure
established by the internal disaster plan of a hospital, the facility or hospital cannot
receive any patients because of a physical plant shutdown (for example, fire, bomb
threat, hostage situation, power outage, flood, etc.) or temporary lack of specialty
equipment (for example, x-ray, CT scan). If a facility calls for any of the above reasons
the Dispatch Center will notify the providers that the facility is “open or closed.”

EXCLUSIONS TO PRE-HOSPITAL DIVERSION
a.

At no time will saturation of critical care or medical beds alone be used as a reason to
initiate pre-hospital diversion. The critically ill patient must be accepted by the facility,
evaluated and stabilized by the emergency department or trauma service or go to
surgery.

b.

Pre-hospital patients exhibiting “uncontrollable medical problems” shall be accepted by
the closest appropriate facility regardless of hospital status. Critical patients shall be
accepted by the closest appropriate hospital when transportation to a more distant
hospital will pose a further significant risk to the patient.

c.

Serious, but stable patients may be routed or re-routed by the providers’ on-line medical
control.

d.

On-line medical control shall remain available at all times from ALS Base hospitals,
regardless of their diversion status.

System overload:
1.

When the entire system is overloaded (many facilities on diversion), all facilities
must open. The EMS system may then be operating in a disaster mode.

2.

When many neighboring facilities are on diversion the affected public safety
agency(s) may request that a facility or facilities re-evaluate their status and
come off diversion, in the interest of public welfare.

PROCEDURE
Emergency department facilities will have the responsibility for notification of the Phoenix Fire
Department Dispatch Center of their diversion status. The emergency department charge nurse,
paramedic coordinator, or other authorized management will normally make this notification.
Upon notification to the Dispatch Center, the emergency medical dispatcher will assure that the
following actions are taken:
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.

Document the time of the call from the facility on the diversion form.
Document the reason for diversion; trauma, ED saturation, or facility internal
disaster/equipment failure.
Notify the EMS transportation providers through the CAD, of hospital diversion.
Follow-up with the affected hospital in three hours to reconfirm the status.
The diversion form is routed through the Dispatch Center chief to the EMS office.

PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to provide the basis for a standard operating procedure that will
enhance firefighter safety and maximize service delivery. It is also important that the Phoenix Fire
Department (PFD), the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office (MCSO) and Correctional Health Services
(CHS) work in a cooperative and collaborative manner to achieve these goals.

DEFINITIONS
Prisoner – An individual deprived of their liberty and kept under involuntary restraint,
confinement, or custody prior to being accepted into an MCSO jail facility. The individuals remain
in the custody of the arresting agency until accepted for confinement in an MCSO jail facility.
Inmate – A prisoner [person] who has been accepted for confinement in an MCSO jail facility.
Once accepted, the individual is now in the custody of MCSO.
CHS – Correctional Health Services, the Maricopa County Department providing medical services
for inmates of MCSO. Personnel include Nurses and Providers.
Nurse – Healthcare personnel employed by Correctional Health Services. The level of care a CHS
nurse can provide is governed by their Medical Director and does not mean they are allowed to
provide equivalent care to that of an ER nurse. NOTE: In many cases, CHS Nurses are not even
permitted to provide the same level of care that a PFD Paramedic is allowed to provide. For
instance, CHS Nurses are not trained or permitted to provide ACLS interventions (e.g., administer
Epinephrine, Intubate, obtain IO access, etc.).
Provider – A term used by CHS personnel to denote an advanced healthcare medical professional
(Dr., NPs, etc.) who has given direction to a CHS Nurse concerning the healthcare of an Inmate.
Providers do not have the ability to dictate the healthcare of a Prisoner or other individual not in
the custody of MCSO. Providers are on-site 24hrs at the MCSO ITR Jail and at various times in
other jails but may also give direction over a telephone.
Medical Unit or Medical – An area designated within every jail where an Inmate (typically those
who are housed in the same jail) can receive medical care. The care provided ranges from basic
healthcare such as medication administration to more advanced types of care. In the Lower
Buckeye Jail, the term “Medical Unit” or “Medical” encompasses specific care provided in certain
areas of the building, yet still considered part of the Medical Unit. This term is somewhat of an
umbrella term that has caused confusion between PFD and MCSO personnel in the past. SEE
Infirmary, Clinic, Psychological Services.

Intake, Transfer, Release (ITR) – Handles all the intake and booking processes of new arrests as
well as self-surrender detainees that are complying with a court order to surrender themselves to
serve a jail sentence. ITR has a transportation hub for the coordinated transport or prisoners and
inmates into and out of custody. All inmates being released from custody will be transported from
their housing unit to the ITR for release processing. (Refer to location illustrations at end of policy
below)
Clinic – A large medical unit, akin to an Urgent Care, within the Lower Buckeye Jail (LBJ) that
provides more advanced medical care to Inmates. Inmates from other MCSO jails are sometimes
transported to the Clinic to receive care. Within the Lower Buckeye Jail, this is where we most
frequently encounter Inmates needing assistance. The Clinic in LBJ is considered to be in the
“Medium-Risk area.” (Refer to location illustrations at end of policy below)
Infirmary – A large medical unit, akin to a nursing home or skilled nursing facility, within the LBJ
that provides long term medical care to inmates. Inmates from other MCSO jails are sometimes
transported to the Infirmary to receive care. The Infirmary in LBJ is considered to be in the
“Medium-Risk area.” (Refer to location illustrations at end of policy below)
Sally Port – A secure, controlled entry way to an enclosure, prison, or jail. The Sally Port to Arizona
State Hospital and Department of Corrections’ facilities are considered to be in the “Medium-Risk
area”. (Refer to location illustrations at end of policy below)
Psychological Services or “Psych Unit” - A large medical unit, akin to an in-patient Behavioral
Health facility, within the LBJ that provides long term behavioral care to inmates. The Psych Unit
in LBJ is considered to be in the High-Risk area. (Refer to location illustrations at end of policy
below)

POLICY
The MCSO operates several jail facilities within the City of Phoenix. These facilities can pose
unique risks and challenges to Fire Companies when responding to, and while operating within,
these facilities.
Some of the risk factors which should be considered when operating in and around MCSO Jail
Facilities include:
• Unpredictable radio communication
• Inability to secure inmate population

PROCEDURE
Before the Incident
•
•

The Fire Department, MCSO and Correctional Health Services shall work collaboratively to
provide training for their personnel to ensure safe and effective operations.
Communication systems shall be in place to ensure all agencies have the capability to
communicate within jail facilities as well as with resources outside of the jail including Fire
Alarm Headquarters (FAHQ) during emergency response incidents.

Incident Communications
•

•

•

Effective radio communication capability is a requirement for the safety of fire personnel and
for the coordination of resources. Fire Department units must always maintain the ability to
communicate with FAHQ as well as with any resources on scene or responding.
When communications are lost, the Company Officer must re-evaluate the incident utilizing
the PFD risk management plan and adjust accordingly. If the crew is unable to receive accurate
and timely information regarding the hazard area or the safety of the work environment, a
change of strategy and the removal of fire personnel from the hazard/work area may be
required.
A Command Officer shall be dispatched to assist with safety concerns, special circumstances
or as may be determined by FAHQ or the Company Officer on scene.

Dispatch And Enroute
FAHQ will gather information from the caller that will assist in properly identifying the situation,
provide direction to the caller to address patient care as necessary (e.g., move the patient to the
CHS medical area, directions for CPR, etc.), and help to ensure that the appropriate resources are
enroute. The information provided should include:
• Access point
• Patient condition and location

•
•
•

If patient has been moved to a safe/secure area (Medium-Risk area)
Are inmates secured/confined
If information on patient location consistently indicates patient is located in the High-Risk
area, incident will be upgraded to a Jail Assignment. A Jail Assignment is an ALS fire
company, Rescue, and a Battalion Chief.
MCSO / CHS Actions
• Patient will be moved to the CHS medical area.
• The goal is to reduce time required for patient contact and expedite treatment and
transportation.
If a patient cannot be moved, inmates must be secured/controlled so as not to present a safety
hazard to fire personnel.
• An MCSO supervisor (Lieutenant, Sergeant, etc.), and the CHS supervisor shall be notified.
• Adequate force protection will be provided for Fire Crews
• Reliable communications must be established

Arrival and On-Scene
•
•
•

•

Fire Department units will operate within an appropriate risk management plan, perform a
thorough scene size-up and maintain a high level of situational awareness.
Company Officers shall utilize adequate force protection from MCSO when operating inside
a High-Risk area.
Fire Department units will be escorted by a MCSO Detention Officer with the capability to
provide redundant communications via MCSO radio and shall remain with the fire
department unit until they exit the interior of the jail facility.
Fire Department units shall verify with MCSO/CHS that the patient is in a secure area and
determine the appropriate area that they will be working in as defined below:

Low-Risk Area – an area that is free of known threats to fire personnel, outside secured areas of
the jail and with reliable communication capability.
Low-Risk Area Operations:
• Operating in the Low-Risk area should be considered similar to other incidents our crews
encounter throughout the city and should be managed utilizing situational awareness and
the Strategic Decision-Making Model.
Medium-Risk Area – The area inside any secured area, up to and including predetermined medical
evaluation areas at the facility (See MCT information/maps), which are agreed upon by both MCSO

PHOENIX REGIONAL

and Fire Department staff. This area will take into consideration our identified risk factors as well
as the most efficient position to extract and transport patients to a definitive care facility.
Medium-Risk Area Operations:
• When operating in the Medium-Risk area, the initial company officer should maintain radio
communication with FAHQ, and all other Fire Crews operating on the scene and remain
situationally aware. The expectation is that Jail staff will extricate patients to this location
for rapid assessment, treatment, and transportation when necessary.
High-Risk Area – Any area beyond the Medium-Risk area or beyond the predetermined medical
evaluation areas (See MCT information/maps) or areas in which communications are
compromised.
High-Risk Area Operations:
All efforts must be made by law enforcement/correctional facility security to extricate the patient
from the High-Risk area to the pre-determined Medium-Risk area /Low-Risk area. Fire department
crews must be advised if this extrication is not possible. This information must be included in the
PFD Risk Management Plan and Incident Action Plan if Incident Command elects to operate within
the High-Risk area.
• When operating in a High-Risk area, the assignment will be upgraded to a Jail Assignment.
The Incident Commander must order additional resources as necessary to address our
mission and compliance with this SOP.
First arriving company officer responsibilities in High-Risk area Operations:
• Perform a size-up based on initial information collected, give an on-scene report and
assume command.
• The on-scene Command Officer shall assume command of the incident and is responsible
for approving the Incident Action Plan.
• Based on size-up and risk management assessment, consider waiting for the arrival of the
balance of the Jail Assignment before proceeding beyond the Medium-Risk area.
• Prior to entering the High-Risk area, develop and communicate an Incident Action Plan that
includes:
o Updated information about the patient, incident, and environment
o Necessary equipment/crew members
o Path to patient
o Plan for extrication of victim

Rescue responsibilities in High-Risk area Operations:
• Stage vehicle in area most conducive to rapid transportation of patient
• Maintain communication with Incident Commander to respond to any pertinent changes in
the Incident Action Plan
Command officer responsibilities in High-Risk area Operations:
• Assume command of the incident and approve the Incident Action Plan
• Monitor radio traffic ensuring communication is reliable
• Address any needs or concerns (preferably prior to crews entering High-Risk area)
• Support with additional resources as necessary

Patient Treatment and Transportation
Fire Department Responsibilities
• Emergency services shall be provided as governed by Phoenix Regional SOP's, Emergency
Medical Services Directives, and Treatment Guidelines. Patients shall be transported to the
closest, most appropriate facility by the safest most appropriate means as determined by
the Company Officer / IC and Online Medical Control (OLMD), when necessary.
MCSO / CHS Responsibilities
• MCSO is responsible for all jail activities related to inmate management. Correctional
Health Services (CHS) is responsible for the administration and management of inmate
medical care and services within their scope of practice. If the patient is not in the MediumRisk area or medical area, every effort should be made to have them moved to this area by
MCSO and/or CHS. Fire Department units should only enter the High-Risk area in
accordance with High-Risk area Operations as listed above.

Patient Transfer from MCSO / CHS to Fire crews
• Fire crews should receive a patient with appropriate medical care prior to transfer. A status
report will be given and should include patient condition, HPI/MOI, and any treatment and
medications given. All patient records should also be included when available.
Stable / Unstable Patient Transportation
• As the medical services provider for MCSO jail facilities, CHS should use their established
protocol of using a private ambulance service for stable/non-acute patients when possible.
• If Fire Department units respond to the CHS Medical area and find a patient in stable
condition under the care of a medical professional, efforts will be made to contact a private
provider for transportation instead of using a Fire Department Rescue.
• An unstable patient necessitating emergency pre-hospital care will be transported by Fire
Department Rescue to the closest, most appropriate hospital facility.
• In most cases, Valleywise Health Medical Center (County Hospital/CH) should get first
consideration when transporting a patient who is in the custody of the MCSO/or other Law
Enforcement Agency.
• When an inmate is being transported by Fire Department rescue, MCSO will accompany
and retain custody of inmates.

Custody at Intake, Transfer, and Release Facilities
Intake, Transfer and Release facilities have unique characteristics related to custody as the names
imply. It is important to familiarize oneself with the terminology related to inmate custody shown
at the beginning of this document.
• Intake
o An intake jail or intake area of a jail is a place where prisoners are brought by an
arresting agency (e.g., Phoenix PD, Mesa PD, DPS, etc.) for processing to determine
if a prisoner will be admitted into a jail facility. Until that processing occurs, and
there is a handoff of the custody of the prisoner to MCSO officers, custody remains
with the arresting agency. NOTE: Not all prisoners are admitted into MCSO jails and
the arresting agency will sometimes release a prisoner who was not admitted.
• Medical Care for individuals in the Custody of Arresting Agency
o If the prisoner requires medical attention prior to the handoff to jail personnel,
custody remains solely with the arresting agency.
o It should be noted that there are instances where the arresting agency may choose
NOT to accompany a prisoner who requires transportation to a hospital, and in
effect, releases the prisoner from their custody. This allows the person to make

PHOENIX REGIONAL

decisions for themselves in an ordinary manner, including the ability to refuse
medical care or transportation.
In situations where fire department medical personnel feel that transporting a
recently released individual poses a safety threat, medical personnel should explain
this to the arresting agency and request, as a professional courtesy, for the arresting
officer to accompany them in the ambulance to the hospital. If the arresting agency
is unwilling to do this, medical personnel should request the appropriate law
enforcement in a manner consistent with other policies and procedures related to
transporting individuals who pose a safety threat.

• Inmates being Transferred
o Inmates are occasionally transferred from one jail to another. These inmates are
already in the custody of MCSO officers and remain in their custody in situations
where medical care and or transportation is required during the transfer process.
This includes an MCSO officer accompanying an inmate (in the ambulance) who
requires transportation.
• Inmate Release
o An inmate who is released by MCSO officers and allowed to exit the jail facilities is
no longer in the custody of MCSO personnel. These individuals retain the same level
of autonomy that any other individual possesses that we may encounter who is not
in the custody of law enforcement.
o The process of releasing an inmate is lengthy and occasionally individuals can have
medical situations during processing. Fire Department company officers should do
their best to understand the current custody status of the individual and request
assistance accordingly. Fire Department personnel should request the appropriate
law enforcement assistance in a manner consistent with other policies and
procedures related to transporting individuals who pose a safety threat.

After the Incident
•

At the completion of an incident where the Fire Department responds to a MCSO jail facility
and a matter of concern arises, an Issue Tracker form shall be completed by the responding
crew. This form will be utilized for quality review purposes by the Problem Resolution
Team.

PURPOSE
This procedure identifies the guidelines and responsibilities when establishing a Deployment Sector.
GUIDELINES
The Planning Section will determine the need to establish a Deployment Sector. Unlike most sectors,
this sector will communicate directly with Planning via telephone rather than a tactical radio channel.
The Planning Section shall make early contact with the Deployment Sector Officer and establish a
phone number for all communications between Planning and Dispatch and Deployment. The Captain
in the Dispatch Center will assume the role of Deployment Sector Officer. In the Captain's absence,
the Dispatch and Deployment Supervisor will assume this role.
RESPONSIBILITIES
The responsibilities assigned to the Deployment Sector will vary somewhat in each situation depending
on type, size and complexity of the incident. The specific responsibilities will include:
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

Maintain adequate Regional coverage throughout the incident.
Make emergency notifications to the appropriate Staff personnel and VIP's as requested.
Assure the incident is assigned sufficient tactical radio channels.
Monitor radio traffic relating to the incident.
Assist and support the Supervisor in managing the Dispatch and Deployment Center.
Provide and coordinate resources or assistance requested by Command and/or Planning
Section.
Continually re-evaluate the need for emergency callback of personnel.
Assist the Planning Section with a plan for rotating Companies to the scene for relief and
overhaul.

The Deployment Sector will be supported by personnel in the Dispatch Center. On multi-alarm
incidents, the Dispatch and Deployment Division Chief will respond to the Dispatch Center and at
his/her discretion, assume the responsibilities of Deployment Sector Officer.

OVERHAUL AND STANDBY ON MAJOR INCIDENTS
M.P. 205.05B

05/95-N

Page 1 of 1

In the aftermath of large-scale fire incidents, the Incident Commander may request fire companies for
extended overhaul or standby. The Dispatch Center, in conjunction with the Incident Commander or
Planning Section, will determine the following:
•
•
•
•

Approximate duration of the overhaul period.
Number of units needed for each rotation.
Time interval for rotation of relief units.
Specific equipment needs.

Taking into consideration the above criteria, the Dispatch Center will develop a plan to deploy
companies for the extent of the overhaul period. The rotation plan will be developed using the following
criteria:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Any company that participated for a substantial period of time at the incident should not be
placed on the rotation list.
Companies that have had high levels of activity during the shift should not be placed on the list
unless it is absolutely necessary. Unit histories should be checked for the day and companies
that have had the least amount of activity should be selected.
ALS and BLS coverage needs should be evaluated to maintain adequate regional coverage in
the response system.
Multiple units from the same geographic area should not be used.
When a plan is developed to deploy multiple units for extended overhaul, the companies
involved will be notified in advance if possible. Notification will include the time to respond, the
duration of their assignment and who their relief will be.
Time of day and travel distances should be taken into consideration if they are a critical factor.
When an outlying company is selected for rotation, an adaptive response unit not used on the
incident should cover for that company. If an adaptive response unit is not available or does not
fall under the above criteria, outlying units should not be used unless absolutely necessary.

Every attempt will be made to adhere to the above criteria in developing the overhaul rotation list.
During times of high activity, some exceptions may be made to allow adequate regional coverage at all
times. This element of deployment should be a regular component of the selection process in the
Dispatch and Deployment Section.

Staging--Basic Operational Approach
The objective of Staging procedures is to provide a standard system of initial placement for responding
apparatus, personnel, and equipment prior to assignment at tactical incidents.
Effective utilization of these procedures will:
•

Prevent excessive apparatus congestion at the scene.

•

Allow time for Command to evaluate conditions prior to assigning companies.

•

Place apparatus in an uncommitted location close to the immediate scene to facilitate more
effective assignment by Command.

•

Reduces radio traffic during the critical initial stages of the incident.

•

Allow Command to formulate and implement a plan without undue confusion and pressure.

•

Provides a resource pool from which Command may assign units and resources at his/her leisure.

Staging involves two levels: LEVEL I and LEVEL II
LEVEL I - STAGING
Level I Staging is automatically in effect for all incidents with three or more companies responding.
During any multi-company response, companies should continue responding to the scene until a
company reports on the scene. In situations where the simultaneous arrival of first due companies is
possible, the affected officers shall utilize radio communications to coordinate activities and eliminate
confusion. It will be the ongoing responsibility of Dispatch to confirm the arrival of the first on-scene
unit.
Once a company announces arrival on the scene, Level I Staging will be implemented in the following
manner:
For Fires, Hazardous Materials, & Special Operations Incidents
The first arriving engine company will respond directly to the scene and initiate appropriate operations.
The first arriving ladder company will respond directly to the scene. They shall announce their
approach to the scene so that Command may commit them to an assignment.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

STAGING LEVELS I AND II

M.P. 205.06

03/03-R

Page 2 of 5

The first chief officer will go directly to the scene and assume Command, all other chief officers should
report to Command.
Rescues (full-time/part-time) will stage in direction of travel, uncommitted approximately one block from
the scene until assigned by Command. When responding from quarters, Rescues shall wait and allow
engine and ladder companies to exit first. In the event a Rescue arrives first on the scene, they will
make an on-scene report and assume Command until an engine, ladder, or chief officer arrives and
Command is transferred.
All other units will stage in their direction of travel, uncommitted, approximately one block from the
scene until assigned by Command. A position providing a maximum of possible tactical options
regarding access, direction of travel, water supply, etc., should be selected. At no time should units
self-assign.
All utility trucks will assume Level I staging. If Level II staging has been implemented, utility trucks will
go to the Level II staging location.

For Multi-Company Response to Medical Emergencies
For multi-company response to medical incidents, in addition to the above, the first arriving ALS unit will
ALSO go directly to the scene and place their apparatus in a location that will provide maximum access
for medical/Rescue support and not impede the movement of other units and indicate their action by
radio.
The first arriving Rescue will ALSO go directly to the scene and park their vehicle in a manner that will
allow quick and unobstructed exit for patient transportation.
All other companies will stage in their direction of travel, approximately one block from the incident.
Staged companies or units will announce their arrival and report their company designation and their
staged location/direction ("Engine One, South").
An acknowledgment is not necessary from either the Dispatch Center or Command. Staged companies
will stay off the air until orders are received from Command. If it becomes apparent Command has
forgotten the company is in a staged position, the company officer shall contact Command and advise
him/her of their staged status.
These staging procedures attempt to reduce unnecessary radio traffic, but in no way should reduce
effective communications or the initiative of officers to communicate. If staged companies observe
critical tactical needs, they will advise Command of such critical conditions and their actions.
LEVEL II - STAGING
Level II Staging is utilized when Command desires to maintain a reserve of resources on-scene, and
when the need to centralize resources is required. Level II Staging places all reserve resources in a
central location and automatically requires the implementation of a Staging Sector Officer.
Level II Staging will be implemented for all greater alarm incidents. Level II staging should be
considered for first alarm medical or hazardous materials incidents, or other incidents in which
Command desires to centralize resources, or simply to park apparatus in a central, unobstructed
location.
Companies which are already staged (Level I) or en-route to Level I Staging, will stay in Level I unless
otherwise directed by Command. All other responding units will proceed to the Level II Staging Area.
When activating Level II Staging, Command will give an approximate location for the Staging Area and
request a separate radio channel for the Staging Sector.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

STAGING LEVELS I AND II

M.P. 205.06

03/03-R

Page 4 of 5

The Staging Area should be some distance away from the Command Post and the emergency scene to
reduce site congestion, but close enough for prompt response to the incident site.

Command should consider Level II Staging when calling for additional resources and request a
separate radio channel. This is more functional than calling for Level II Staging while units are enroute. The additional units will be dispatched to the Staging Area. Responding units should monitor
both the tactical and staging channels.
Command may designate a Staging Area and Staging Officer who will be responsible for the activities
outlined in this procedure. In the absence of such an assignment, the first fire department officer to
arrive at the Staging Area will automatically become the Staging Officer and will notify Command on
arrival. The arrival notification will be made to Command on the assigned tactical channel.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

STAGING LEVELS I AND II

M.P. 205.06

Page 5 of 5

Due to the limited number of ladder companies, a ladder officer will transfer responsibility for Staging to
the first arriving engine company officer. Staging Officers will assign their company members as
needed to assist with Staging operations, or assign them to another company.
All responding companies will stay off the air, respond directly to the designated Staging Area, and the
Company Officer will report in person to the Staging Officer. The crew will standby their unit with crew
intact and warning lights turned off until assigned incident site duties, or released from the scene.
When assigned to on-site duties, companies leaving staging will communicate directly with Command
or their assigned sector officer for instructions.
Once Level II staging is implemented, all communications involving staging will be between Staging
and Command or Logistics.
STAFF CHIEF OFFICERS AND CAPTAINS
Arrival on the scene of staff Chief Officers and Captains can enhance the Command organization and
incident management. Unless arriving staff officers have predetermined responsibilities (i.e., Safety
Sector, Haz Mat Sector), these officers should assume a Level I staging posture and announce their
arrival on the tactical channel. If the Staging Sector has been assigned a separate radio channel,
notification should be on the designated channel.
Vehicle parking at the site can be limited. Staff officers should leave their vehicles in the Staging
Sector, or park well off the road (i.e., parking lots) so as not to restrict on-site access by fire apparatus.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

STAGING SECTOR

M.P. 205.06A

03/03-R

Page 1 of 2

This procedure defines the responsibilities of the Staging Sector Officer. Level II staging is
implemented by Command and should be utilized for all greater alarm incidents, first alarm medical or
hazardous materials incidents, or other incidents in which Command desires to centralize resources, or
simply park apparatus in a central, unobstructed location.
Level II staging will require all responding companies to report to the central staging location.
Implementation of Level II staging automatically requires the implementation of a "Staging Sector"
Officer. Command should request a separate radio channel and may designate a Staging Sector
Officer. Where an officer is not designated, the first company to arrive at the designated staging
location will automatically become the staging officer.

Where the first company to staging is a ladder company, Staging Sector responsibilities should be
transferred to an engine company officer upon his arrival on the scene.
Radio designation will be "Staging Sector."
Command will request a separate radio channel to be used for Command Post to Staging Sector
communications and advise the Staging Sector Officer.
The staging area should be outside the incident site perimeter, but close enough for quick response to
the scene. The staging area should allow staged companies to access any geographic point of the
incident without delay or vehicle congestion.

The staging officer will also be responsible for the following functions:
1. Locate an area of adequate size for all apparatus, including apparatus that may respond with
additional alarms.
2. Transmit the staging area location to Command and Dispatch, indicating access and routing as
needed.
3. Coordinate with the Police Department to block streets, intersections, and other access required for
the staging area.
4. Ensure that all apparatus is parked in an appropriate manner for quick exit.
5. Maintain a log of companies available in the staging area and inventory all specialized equipment
that might be required at the scene.
6. Maintain crews in a ready state with their apparatus.
7. Provide progress reports to Command indicating number and type of units available.
8. Assume a position that is visible and accessible to incoming and staged companies. This will be
accomplished by leaving the red lights operating on the staging officers apparatus and by wearing a
sector vest.
9. Assign staged companies to incident duty per Command’s direction.
When directed by Command, the Staging Officer will verbally assign companies to report to specific
sectors, telling them where and to whom to report. Staging will then advise Command of the specific
unit assigned. Command will advise each sector officer the companies being assigned to the sector.
The receiving Sector Officer may then communicate directly with the company by radio.
When assigned to incident site duties, companies will activate their MCT "on-scene" button.
The Staging Sector Officer will give Command periodic reports of available companies in staging.
Command will utilize this information to request additional resource as needed.
The Staging Sector Officer should organize staging in a manner that will allow apparatus to effectively
move into and out of staging. Adequate space between apparatus is required. Ladders companies
should be placed in one area, engines in another, and rescues in another area.
Where only staff or specialized equipment is needed at the scene, staging should arrange a "taxi"
service using a single company to deliver multiple crews or specialized equipment to the scene. This
will minimize site congestion.
During major incidents where a "Logistics" Section is implemented, the Staging Sector will be working
under the direction of the Logistics Officer.

PHOENIX REGIONAL

APPARATUS PLACEMENT

M.P. 205.07

01/95-R

Page 1 of 3

Apparatus function should regulate placement. Poor apparatus placement can reverse this rule,
limiting the options or eliminating functions we can assign to a unit.
Fire fighters operate with a natural inclination to drive apparatus as close to the fire as possible. This
often results in positioning of apparatus that is both dysfunctional and dangerous. The placement of all
apparatus on the fireground should be a reflection of the following:
Standard operational procedure for first arriving companies.
Tactical objectives and priorities.
Staging procedure.
A direct order from Command.
A conscious decision on the part of the Company officer based on existing or predictable
conditions.

•
•
•
•
•

Effective apparatus placement must begin with the arrival of first units. The placement of the initial
arriving engine, ladder, and Rescue should be based upon initial size-up and general conditions upon
arrival. First arriving companies should place themselves to maximum advantage and go to work; later
arriving units should be placed in a manner that builds on the initial plan and allows for expansion of the
operation.
Avoid "belly to butt" placement on the fireground. Do not drive all fire apparatus directly to the fire.
Later arriving companies should stage a minimum of one block short of the immediate fire area, and
remain uncommitted until ordered into action by Command. Company officers should select staged
positions with a maximum of tactical options (See Level I Staging procedures).
In large, complex, and lengthy fireground operations additional alarm companies should be staged
consistent with Level II Staging procedure. Under these procedures, Command communicates directly
with the Staging Officer for the additional resource required on the fireground.
Command must maintain an awareness of site access that provides tactical options and that the
immediate fire area can quickly become congested with apparatus. The officer must regard apparatus
on the fireground in two categories:
·
·

Apparatus that is working
Apparatus that is parked

Park out of the way. Apparatus that is not working should be left in the Staging Area or parked where it
will not compromise access.
Maintain an access lane down the center of streets wherever possible.
Think of fire apparatus as an expensive exposure: position working apparatus in a manner that
considers the extent and location of the fire and a pessimistic evaluation of fire spread and building
failure. Anticipate the heat which may be released with structural collapse. Forecast where the fire is
going and how it will affect exposure of apparatus. Apparatus should generally be positioned at least

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

APPARATUS PLACEMENT

M.P. 205.07

01/95-R

Page 2 of 3

30 ft. away from involved buildings, even with nothing showing. Greater distances are indicated in
many situations.
Beware of putting fire apparatus in places where it cannot be repositioned easily and
quickly--particularly operating positions with only one way in and out; i.e., yards, alleys, driveways, etc.
Beware of overhead power lines when positioning apparatus. Do not park where lines may fall.
If apparatus does become endangered, activate engine sprinkler system and operate hoselines
between it and the fire while you reposition it. When you do move it--move it to a position that is safe.
It is dysfunctional to move apparatus several times throughout the progress of a fire.
Take maximum advantage of good operating positions and "build" the capability of units assigned to
these effective positions. Initial arriving pumpers should be placed in "key" positions. These positions
should offer maximum fire attack access to the fire area and be supplied with large diameter pumped
supply lines as quickly as possible. Subsequent arriving companies can operate the hoselines from
this apparatus. Place these "key" companies
first--before access is blocked by later arriving units.
Key tactical positions should be identified and engines placed in those locations with a strong water
supply. The water supply should be at least one pumped line from an engine on a hydrant. When high
volume is indicated, two pumped supply lines should be provided. The forward engine can distribute
this water supply to a variety of hand lines, master streams or devices.
Take full advantage of hydrants close to the fire before laying additional supply lines to distant
hydrants. Secondary hydrants should be used to obtain additional supply if the demand exceeds the
capability of the closest hydrants.
Take advantage of the equipment on apparatus already in the fire area instead of bringing in more
apparatus. Connect extra lines to pumpers which already have a good supply line instead of making
"daisy chain" supply line connections.
Do not hook up to hydrants so close to the fire building that structural failure or fire extension will
jeopardize the apparatus.
Fire hose soon limits the general access as the fireground operation gets older. Command and
Sectors must direct apparatus to important positions as early as possible. Lines should be laid with
attention to the access problems they present. Try to lay lines on the same side of street as the
hydrant and cross over near the fire.
When the aerial apparatus is not needed for upper level access or Rescue, spot apparatus in a position
that would provide an effective position for elevated stream operation if the fire goes to a defensive
mode. Ladder officers must consider extent and location of fire, most dangerous direction of spread,
confinement, exposure conditions, overhead obstructions and structural conditions in spotting
apparatus. The truck should be spotted where the aerial can be raised and used effectively without
repositioning. It must also be spotted for effective use of hand ladders and allied forcible entry
equipment.

Command vehicles should be positioned at a location that will allow maximum visibility of the fire
building and surrounding area and the general effect of the companies operating on the fire. Command
vehicle position should be easy and logical to find and should not restrict the movement of other
apparatus.
Rescue units should be spotted in a safe position that will provide the most effective treatment and
transportation of fire victims and fire fighting personnel, while not blocking movement of other
apparatus or interfering with fire fighting operations. Staff vehicle placement should go to Level II
staging unless that staff person has a pre-designated responsibility (i.e., Safety Sector). The staging
sector officer will advise Command of staff personnel available for assignment.

Safe Parking While Operating in or Near Vehicle Traffic
M.P. 205.07A

04/18

Page 1 of 6

Purpose
This procedure identifies parking practices for Fire Department apparatus that will provide
maximum protection and safety for personnel operating in or near moving vehicle traffic. It also
identifies several approaches for individual practices to keep firefighters safe while exposed to
vehicle traffic.
It shall be the policy of the Regional Fire Department to position apparatus at the scene of
emergences in a manner that best protects the work area and personnel from vehicle traffic
and other hazards.
All personnel should understand and appreciate the high risk that firefighters are exposed to
when operating in or near moving vehicle traffic. We should always operate from a defensive
posture. Always consider moving vehicles as a threat to your safety. Each day, emergency
personnel are exposed to motorists of varying abilities, with or without licenses, with or
without legal restrictions, and driving at speeds from creeping to well beyond the speed limit.
Some of these motorists could be the vision impaired, or alcohol and/or drug impaired. On top
of everything else, motorists will often be looking at the scene and not the road.
Nighttime operations are particularly hazardous. Visibility is reduced, and the flashing of
emergency lights tend to confuse motorists. Studies have shown that multiple headlights of
emergency apparatus (coming from different angles at the scene) tend to blind drivers as they
approach.
Safety Benchmarks
Emergency personnel are at great risk while operating in or around moving traffic. There are
approaches that can be taken to protect yourself and all crewmembers:
 Never trust the traffic
 Engage in proper protective parking
 Always wear high visibility reflective vests
 Reduce motorist vision impairment
 Use traffic cones and flares
Listed below are benchmarks for safe performance when operating in or near moving vehicle
traffic.
 Always maintain an acute awareness of the high risk of working in or around moving
traffic. Never trust moving traffic. Always look before you step! Always keep an eye on
the traffic!

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Safe Parking While Operating in or Near Vehicle Traffic
M.P. 205.07A

Page 2 of 6

 Always position apparatus to protect the scene, patients, emergency personnel, and
provide a protected work area. Where possible, angle apparatus at 45 degrees away
from curbside. This will direct motorist around the scene (See Figure 1). Apparatus
positioning must also allow for adequate parking space for other fire apparatus (if
needed), and a safe work area for emergency personnel. Allow enough distance to
prevent a moving vehicle from knocking fire apparatus into the work areas.
 At intersections, or where the incident may be near the middle of the street, two or
more sides of the incident may need to be protected. Block all exposed sides. Where
apparatus is in limited numbers, prioritize the blocking from the most critical to the least
critical (See Figures 2, 3 and 4).
 For first arriving engine companies, where a charged hoseline may be needed, angle the
engine so that the pump panel is "downstream," on the opposite side of on‐coming
traffic. This will protect the pump operator (See Figure 5).
 The initial company officer (or Command) must assess the parking needs of later‐
arriving fire apparatus and specifically direct the parking and placement of these
vehicles as they arrive to provide protective blocking of the scene. This officer must
operate as an initial safety officer.
 During daytime operations, leave all emergency lights on to provide warning to drivers.
 For NIGHTTIME operations, turn OFF fire apparatus headlights. This will help reduce the
blinding effect to approaching vehicle traffic. Other emergency lighting should be
reduced to yellow lights and emergency flashers where possible.
 Crews should exit the curb side or non‐traffic side of the vehicle whenever possible.
 Always look before stepping out of apparatus, or into any traffic areas. When walking
around fire apparatus parked adjacent to moving traffic, keep an eye on traffic and walk
as close to fire apparatus as possible.
 Always wear a safety vest any time you are operating in or near vehicle traffic.
 When parking apparatus to protect the scene, be sure to protect the work area also. The
area must be protected so that patients can be extricated, treated, moved about the
scene and loaded into Rescues safely.
 Once enough fire apparatus have "blocked" the scene, park or stage unneeded vehicles
off the street whenever possible. Bring in Rescue/Ambulance companies one or two at a
time and park them in safe locations at the scene. This may be "downstream" from
other parked apparatus, or the Rescue may be backed at an angle into a protected
loading area to prevent working in or near passing traffic.
 At residential medical emergencies, park Rescue in driveways for safe loading where
possible. If driveways are inaccessible, park Rescue to best protect patient loading areas.
(See Figures 6 and 7).
 Place traffic cones at the scene to direct traffic. This should be initiated by the first
company arriving on the scene and expanded, if needed, as later arriving companies
arrive on the scene. Always place and retrieve cones while facing on‐coming traffic.

 Placing flares, where safe to do so, adjacent to and in combination with traffic cones for
nighttime operations greatly enhances scene safety. Place flares to direct traffic where
safe and appropriate to do so. Listed below are general recommendations for the start
of traffic cones/flares:
Speed
25 mph
40 mph
60 mph

Distance
65 feet
105 feet
160 feet

 At major intersections, a call for police response may be necessary. Provide specific
direction to the police officer as to exactly what your traffic control needs are. Ensure
the police are parking to protect themselves and the scene. Position Rescues to protect
patient loading areas. (See Figure 8)
Freeway Operations
Freeway emergencies pose a particularly high risk to emergency personnel. Speeds are higher,
traffic volume is significant, and motorists have little opportunity to slow, stop or change lanes.
The Department of Public Safety will also have a desire to keep the freeway traffic flowing.
Where need be, the freeway can be completely shut down. This, however, rarely occurs.
For freeway emergencies, we will continue to block the scene with the first apparatus on the
scene to provide a safe work area. Other companies may be used to provide additional
protection if needed. The initial company officer, or command, must thoroughly assess the
need for apparatus on the freeway and their specific positions. Companies should be directed
to specific parking locations to protect the work area, patients and emergency personnel.
Other apparatus should be parked downstream when possible. This provides a safe parking
area.
Staging of Rescue companies off the freeway may be required. Rescues should be brought into
the scene one or two at a time. A safe loading area must be established.
Traffic cones should be placed farther apart, with the last cone approximately 160 feet
"upstream," to allow adequate warning to drivers. Place and retrieve cones while facing the
traffic.
Command should establish a liaison with the Department of Public Safety as soon as possible to
jointly provide a safe parking and work area and to quickly resolve the incident. The
termination of the incident must be managed with the same aggressiveness as initial actions.

PURPOSE
This procedure identifies the minimum standards for the operation and supervision of emergency
vehicle movement and safety.
ARIZONA MOTOR VEHICLE CODE AND SAFETY
It is the responsibility of the driver of each Fire Department vehicle to drive safe, in a reasonable
and prudent manner at all times. Vehicles shall be operated in compliance with the Arizona Motor
Vehicle Code. This code provides specific legal exceptions to regular traffic regulations, which
apply to properly equipped and authorized Fire Department vehicles only when responding to an
emergency incident or when transporting a patient to a medical facility. Emergency response
(Code 3) does not absolve the driver of the responsibility to drive with due caution and reasonable
care. The driver of the emergency vehicle is responsible for its safe operation at all times. This
responsibility includes but is not limited to the following:
1. All City of Phoenix employees are required to wear seat belts at all times when operating
a City vehicle.
2. Anyone riding as a passenger/attendant in a City vehicle is also required to wear seat belts
(e.g., Rescue, Engine, Ladder, Utility, Squad, Staff Vehicle, etc.). The Driver and/or
Company Officer of the vehicle will confirm that all personnel and riders are on-board,
properly attired, with seat belts on, before the vehicle is permitted to move.
3. Drivers shall avoid backing whenever possible. Where backing is unavoidable, spotters
shall always be used. If no spotter is available, the driver shall dismount and walk
completely around the apparatus to determine if obstructions are present before backing
(Refer to M.P. 205.08A Standard Signals for Backing of Fire Department Apparatus).
4. All personnel shall ride only in regular seats provided with seat belts. Riding on tailboards
or in other exposed positions is not permitted on any vehicle at any time.

DRIVER SAFETY
Page 1 of 5

5. The unique hazards of driving on or adjacent to the fire ground require the driver to use
extreme caution and to be alert and prepared to react to the unexpected.
6. Drivers must consider the dangers their moving vehicle poses to fire ground personnel and
spectators who may be preoccupied with the emergency and may inadvertently step in
front of or behind a moving vehicle.
EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY
Phoenix Fire Department vehicles shall be operated in a manner that provides for the safety of all
persons and property. Prompt, safe response shall be attained by:
1. Leaving the station in a standard professional manner;
2. Quickly mounting apparatus;
3. All personnel on board, seated with seat belts on;
4. Station apparatus bay doors open fully;
5. Driving defensively and professionally at reasonable speeds;
6. Knowing where we are going (i.e., your destination and routing), effectively managing
multiple other tasks (e.g., Mobile Computer Terminal monitoring, alarm room updates,
road closers, staging locations, hydrant locations, etc.); and
7. Using warning devices to move around traffic and to request the right-of-way in a safe and
predictable manner.
Fast response shall not be attained by:
1. Leaving quarters before crew has mounted safely and before apparatus bay doors are fully
open.
2. Driving too fast for conditions.
3. Driving recklessly or without regard for safety.
4. Taking unnecessary chances with negative right-of-way intersections.
CODE 3 EMERGENCY RESPONSE STANDARDS
The following rules govern emergency response:
1. Maximum of 10 mph over posted speed limit.
2. Recognizing there will be a brief deceleration period, maximum of 20 mph when traveling
in center or oncoming traffic lanes.
3. When traveling in center or oncoming traffic lanes, complete stop at all stop signs and
traffic lights regardless of the color of the light.
4. When traveling with traffic, complete stop at all red lights, and stop signs.
RESPONSE ACKNOWLEDGMENT
Response codes will be displayed on the Mobile Computer Terminal (MCT). If no response code
is designated, the response will be Code 2 unless directed by a Company Officer. Officers and
Rescue Attendants must press the correlating response code button on the MCT or through
notification to the Alarm Room on the appropriate tactical radio channel.
DRIVER SAFETY
Page 2 of 5

Response codes for all emergency response vehicles will be determined by the Company Officer
based on information received from the Alarm Room, time of day, traffic conditions, weather
conditions, and other factors.
Rescue units will respond as directed by deployment policy; they do not have the authority to
upgrade their response to Code 3 unless directed by the responding or on scene Company Officer.
When a Rescue is the “first due” unit on a BLS incident they will respond as directed by the Alarm
Room or the responding Company Officer. Rescue crews should keep the responding Company
Officer apprised (by radio) of excessive time delays or other conditions that may warrant an
upgrade to Code 3.
CODE 3 DRIVER AND CO-DRIVER RESPONSIBILITIES
Fire Department emergency response vehicles shall have 2 PFD members in the front seats of the
vehicle whenever possible while responding Code 3. In addition to supervisory responsibilities,
Company Officers or ranking Officers in the front seats have Co-driver responsibilities.
1. The Driver is responsible for operating the vehicle safely and compliance with this policy.
2. The Co-driver is responsible for being a second set of eyes and ears anytime a unit is
responding Code 3.
3. Driver and Co-driver must be focused on intersection management any time a PFD vehicle
enters an intersection Code 3.
4. Intersection management requires the Drivers and Co-driver’s undivided attention.
5. The Co-driver and the Driver should be accounting for clearance in all traffic lanes including
pedestrian traffic.
6. Where a complete stop is required by policy, the Co-driver shall announce if it is clear or
not clear to proceed. The Driver makes the final decision of when it is clear to proceed.
Note: The Company Officer or ranking Officer is responsible for safety and policy compliance.
CODE 3 DRIVING POLICY
Fire Department Drivers and Co-drivers will comply with the following while operating vehicles
Code 3:
1. When responding Code 3, warning lights must be on and sirens must be sounded to warn
drivers of other vehicles, as required by the Arizona Motor Vehicle Code.
a. The use of sirens and warning lights does not automatically give the right-of-way to
the emergency vehicle. These devices simply request the right-of-way from other
drivers, based on their awareness of the emergency vehicle.
b. Emergency vehicle drivers must make every possible effort to make their presence
and intended actions known to other drivers and must drive defensively to be
prepared for the unexpected inappropriate actions of others.

DRIVER SAFETY
Page 3 of 5

2. Fire Department vehicles are authorized to exceed posted speed limits only when
responding Code 3 under favorable conditions. Under these conditions a maximum of 10
mph over the posted speed limit is authorized.
a. Recognizing there will be a brief deceleration period, when an emergency vehicle
must travel in center or oncoming traffic lanes, the maximum permissible speed
shall be 20 mph.
b. When an emergency vehicle must use center or oncoming traffic lanes to approachcontrolled intersections (traffic light or stop sign), the vehicle must come to a
complete stop before proceeding through the intersection, including occasions
when the vehicle has a green traffic light.
c. When an emergency vehicle approaches a negative right-of-way intersection (red
light or stop sign), the vehicle shall come to a complete stop and may proceed only
when the Driver can account for all oncoming traffic in all lanes yielding the rightof-way.
3. Code 3 response is authorized only in conjunction with emergency incidents. Unnecessary
emergency response shall be avoided. To avoid any unnecessary emergency response, on
multi-company responses, the first arriving unit (Incident Commander) will advise
additional units to respond Code 2 when appropriate.
4. During an emergency response, fire vehicles should avoid passing other emergency
vehicles. If passing is necessary, permission must be obtained through radio
communications, using the communications order model.
5. Water Tenders are not permitted to respond Code III.
ALS AND BLS EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORT
Response codes for Rescue units during patient transport will be established by the on-scene
Company Officer prior to the Rescue unit leaving the scene. If the on-scene Company Officer
determines that a Code 3 transport is required, the Company Officer should make every
reasonable effort to have a crewmember in the Co-driver position. Emergency medical transport
status shall be recorded via LV3 MCT code or via the tactical radio channel to the Alarm Room.
In the event a Rescue must change the response status from Code 2 to Code 3 while en route to a
medical facility, the members should make every effort to reassign available personnel to the Codriver position and rapid notification should be made to the Alarm Room.
During a transport, if at any time an attendant must remove their seatbelt to treat a critical patient,
the following must occur:
1. The attendant must determine the urgency of the needed treatment and the most
appropriate time during transport to accomplish the treatment.
2. The Driver will be notified of the needed treatment and will pull over when possible to allow
for the attendant to perform the treatment. Once the treatment is completed and the
attendant is seat-belted, the transport will continue.
DRIVER SAFETY
Page 4 of 5

3. If the transport needs to continue due to patient’s life-threatening condition or patient care
dictates, the attendant should advise the Driver that they are going to be unrestrained to
perform critical treatment. The critical treatment will be performed, and the attendant will
return to the belted position immediately.
4. The Driver and attendant should communicate about the condition of the patient and
changes in driving conditions. If appropriate, the Driver should communicate about
upcoming turns, braking or changes in traffic conditions.
DRIVER/OPERATOR, SUPERVISOR, & MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
It is the responsibility of the Driver/Operator of each Fire Department vehicle/apparatus to comply
with the Arizona Motor Vehicle Code and this policy. When determining whether a violation of this
policy has occurred, the Fire Department will consider the fact that driving, and supervision of
policy compliance, are inherently divided attention tasks and that human factors can sometimes
cause minor deviations from policy requirements. An example of a minor deviation is
momentarily exceeding maximum allowable speed by 5 mph or less. Conversely, an example of
a major deviation is traveling through a controlled intersection without stopping when required
or exceeding allowable speed limits by 10 mph or more; in these instances, the violation must be
reported up the chain of command and will be managed through the disciplinary process.
The Company Officer or ranking Officer in the vehicle is ultimately responsible for policy
compliance. The Fire Department recognizes that all fire department vehicles do not have the same
tools to assist with monitoring policy compliance. For example, when vehicles do not have a
passenger speedometer, it could be difficult for a Company Officer to notice minor deviations of
speed. However, when the Company Officer or ranking Officer recognizes or should reasonably
recognize a violation of policy, they have a duty to act to stop the violation.

SPOTTING FIRE DEPARTMENT APPARATUS
M.P. 205.08A

08/20-R

Page 1 of 2

APPARATUS BACKING/FORWARD MOVEMENT – DRIVERS AND SPOTTERS
Backing of Fire Department apparatus should be avoided whenever possible. Where backing is
unavoidable spotters shall be used. In addition, spotters shall be used when apparatus must negotiate
forward turns with restrictive side clearances and where height clearances are uncertain.
Under circumstances where the apparatus is manned by only the driver, that driver shall attempt to
utilize any available fire department personnel to act as spotters. Where no personnel are available to
assist, the driver shall get out of the apparatus and make a complete 360-degree survey of the area
around the apparatus to determine if any obstructions are present.
Spotters will discuss the backing plan with the driver before proceeding. A primary spotter will be
designated, and the communication/warning process will be agreed upon prior to backing. The primary
spotter is usually located at the left rear corner of the apparatus, but this position will be designated
according to the safest backing plan agreed upon. Both door windows (driver and front passenger)
should be in the down position to allow for maximum communication/hearing between spotters and the
engineer/driver. Fire radio volumes will be turned down and the driver will take their headset off.
Where engine or ladder apparatus are backed, all crew members (except the driver/tiller person) will
dismount the apparatus and act as spotters, including the Company Officer. Spotters should be located
at as many corners as possible with at least one spotter at the left rear corner of the apparatus. Where
only a single spotter is available, the spotter will coordinate with the driver to negotiate the apparatus
most successfully. Rear spotters will remain a reasonably safe distance (10-15 feet) behind the
apparatus and be in position to visualize the driver’s eyes in the side mirror.
The apparatus shall not be backed until all spotters are in position and communicate their approval to
start the backing. Spotters will remain visible to the engineer/driver. Anytime the driver loses sight of
the primary spotter, the apparatus shall be stopped immediately until the spotter is visible, and the
communication to continue backing is processed. Drivers will not back the apparatus faster than the
spotters can safely walk backwards, allowing them to stay a safe distance from the apparatus. Spotters
must be aware of approaching hazards and never place themselves between the moving apparatus
and an object.
When the apparatus must be backed where other vehicle traffic exists, the emergency lights (if
equipped) shall be operating and orange safety vests shall be worn by all spotters.
At night, the apparatus flood lights (if equipped) should be utilized to light surrounding objects and the
spotter’s location. The spotters should never use flashlights to signal the driver.
The Company Officer is responsible for compliance with this procedure and the safe backing of the
apparatus.
SIGNALS
STRAIGHT BACK: Two hands above the head with palms toward face, waving back.

STOP: Both arms crossed with hands making a fist. Be sure to yell the stop order loud enough that the
engineer/driver can hear the warning.
TURN: Both arms pointing the same direction with index fingers extended. (The direction that was
agreed upon through prior verbal communication).
HARD TURN: Both arms pointing the same direction with index fingers extended with animated and
exaggerated motion away from the body.
STRAIGHTEN APPARATUS: Arms and hands animated pointing up and down.
HANDOFF: Point to your eyes and then to the other spotter that the driver should look at.
LOOK AT THIS: If the spotter sees that the apparatus is approaching an object the driver may not see,
STOP the driver and point to your eyes and then point to the object you want the driver to see.
DIMINISHING CLEARANCE: Arms out wide, as the distance gets closer, so should your arms, and at
shoulder width the spotter should change the signal to STOP.
SLOW: If the driver is backing too fast, put your hands forward, pushing down, or stop the driver and
have a discussion at the driver’s window.

Emergency Transportation Safe Customer Escort
M.P. 205.08B

04/18

Page 1 of 2

Purpose
The following procedure identifies factors to consider when deciding to allow a customer escort
in rescues during emergency transportation to the hospital.
Background
It is the policy of the Phoenix Fire Department to extend the highest customer service to all
those we encounter in our daily activities. This includes allowing escorts to travel with a patient
in a rescue during emergency transportation. Each escort in a rescue increases the number of
possible exposures to infections, contamination and physical dangers to fire personnel. This
procedure may help to reduce the number of exposures to fire personnel while transporting
patients to the emergency department. This procedure requires fire personnel to balance
customer service considerations to the escort during emergency transports, versus safety in
regard to physical danger, infectious exposure and possible contamination to fire personnel.
Customer Service Considerations
The following may be reasons for transporting a patient with an escort in the rescue.





Patient Care. Patient care is enhanced and assisted by having an escort for the patient in
the rescue. Examples may be having a mother escort her young child for comfort during
patient care or fire personnel requiring an escort who has the knowledge of a second
language, i.e., Spanish, American Sign Language, etc.
Family Member (Escort) Care. Added value service is enhanced by having the family
member escort the patient in the rescue. An example would be an elderly spouse
needing to be with their critical family member who is being transported.
Parent Escort. Enhances child patient care, customer service and meets legalities for
transporting and treating agencies. An example would be a parent escorting an under‐
legal age child for treatment and consent purposes.

Use of seat belts by the escorts is mandatory. Small adults or young children should not ride in
any rescue cab with airbags installed.

Exposures, Contaminations, and Physical Danger Considerations
The following considerations may be used to refuse an escort in a rescue when transporting a
patient to an emergency department.




Infectious Exposures. When information indicates possible infectious exposure to the
patient or fire personnel by the escort. An example may be information that the escort
has active TB.
Contamination. When information indicates possible contamination that may expose
fire personnel, equipment or vehicle. An example may be that the escort has signs of
obvious body fluids on their skin, clothing or possessions.
Danger to Rescue Driver or Patient. When information indicates possible physical danger
to fire personnel or to the patient by the escort. An example may be that the escort
exhibits signs of social or behavioral stress, or possible alcohol or drug intoxication.

Rescue Crew Responsibility
It is the responsibility of rescue personnel to discuss the above considerations with the on‐
scene fire officer prior to allowing an escort to travel in the rescue.
Company Officer Responsibility
It is the responsibility of the Company Officer on scene to obtain and consider the above
information before a decision is made to allow an escort to ride with the patient in the rescue.
When the negative considerations outweigh the positive considerations, an escort is not
advised. The Company Officer on scene will make the final decision.
In the spirit of customer service, information on other means of transportation should be
provided to the customer such as taxi services, private automobiles, buses, safe ride, etc.

ADAPTIVE RESPONSE UNITS

M.P. 205.09

09/09-R

Page 1 of 1

The Adaptive Response Engine Company Program provides additional engine companies in the
dispatch system. These companies should be considered for use as substitutes for companies which
are out of service for extended periods of time due to training, maintenance, emergency incidents or
other approved company activities. The purpose of this procedure is to provide move-up guidelines for
adaptive response companies.
Move-Up Responsibility
The AHQ Chief (BC), along with the Alarm Room Supervisor and Lead Dispatchers are responsible for
management of adaptive response move-ups. Together, they review the company activity calendar
each morning. Special events, scheduled and unscheduled out-of-service activity and requests from
field BC’s and company officers must be considered.
Company officers are responsible for prompt and efficient relocation to areas when assigned by alarm.
Outlying areas which normally have increased response times (due to sparser coverage) shall be
covered whenever possible.
Move-Up Criteria
Adaptive Response Company move-ups will be made for both scheduled and emergency activity that
places engine companies out of service for extended periods of time. Move-ups should be considered
for the following situations:
1. All working incidents that will keep a number of companies out-of-service for extended periods.
2. All working incidents that have high degree of likelihood of escalating to greater alarms.
3. Extended scheduled company activity which depletes coverage in outlying areas.
Move-Up Notification
Move-ups should be made as soon as Dispatch has knowledge that coverage will be necessary.
Companies identified for scheduled move-up assignments should be notified in advance if possible to
allow company officers and crews to plan accordingly. Unscheduled move-up notification will be made
through the normal CAD entry move-up and Channel 1 notification, unless it is convenient to notify
crews via landline. The direct ring down "99" telephone notification may also be used for move-ups.
When a move-up requires a company to leave their city (ie: Glendale), the appropriate Shift
Commander should be notified.
Responding to Assigned Move-up location
Company officers of Adaptive Response Companies will immediately collect their crewmembers and
respond to the move-up location. Move-ups will normally be under a non-emergency Code 2 status.
Dispatch, however, may order a Code 3 response under critical emergency conditions. Companies
should respond to their move-up assignment in an “out of service” status, while monitoring Channel
One and may respond to nearby calls at the discretion of the Company Officer.
Returning to First Due Areas
Companies which have had their areas covered by adaptive response units should return to their first
due area and go in service promptly when their activity has concluded. Adaptive Response Units shall
stay in their move-up location (in service) until assigned by alarm to return to their first due or another
location. Adaptive Response Units should monitor Channel One while returning to their own first due in
an “out of service” status and respond to calls in their proximity at the discretion of the company officer.

LADDER TENDER RESPONSE

M.P. 205.10

03/03-R

Page 1 of 1

Ladder Tenders
The objective of operating a ladder tender in conjunction with a ladder truck housed at a fire station is
to provide a full level of truck capabilities, while extending the service life of the larger, more costly
apparatus. Ladder tender (LT) vehicles are purchased at a fraction of the cost of full-sized truck
companies and are intended to be utilized wherever they are deemed adequate (i.e., E.M.S. calls,
special duties, extrications, etc.). Ladder tenders may provide Basic Life Support (LT) or with an
Advanced Life Support Team (LPT).
Response to Structural Alarms
When responding from quarters, a complete crew will respond on the Ladder Truck to all structural
assignments of 3-1 or greater magnitude. The company officer may choose to bring along the Ladder
Tender to increase the flexibility of the company at the scene (i.e. two-piece company).

If the crew is dispatched to a structural assignment while out of quarters in the Ladder Tender, the
company will respond to the incident in the Ladder Tender. Dispatch must be advised that response is
with a Ladder Tender. The TRO will then relay this information to all responding units. When
responding with a Ladder Tender, it will sometimes be necessary for Ladder Tender personnel to use
hand ladders or other equipment off engine companies at the scene. A pessimistic approach is
essential, and if any indicators suggest that the apparatus may not be adequate to handle the incident
(i.e., multi-story building, ladder pipe potential, etc.) a backup Ladder Truck should be requested.
Response to B.L.S. Dispatches
The officer in charge of a two-piece truck company may choose to respond to a B.L.S. dispatch with a
minimum four-member crew on the Ladder Tender.
In summary, a pessimistic approach is required when a question exists as to whether a ladder tender
response is adequate for an incident. A good rule to follow: when in doubt, request a Ladder company
backup.

WATER TENDER RESPONSE

M.P. 205.11

01/95-R

Page 1 of 1

The following policy regulates the dispatch, response and use of water tender apparatus.
All company officers will use their discretion in calling for water tender assistance and should be alert to
areas in their response zones that will require the additional water carried on water tenders.
Company officers having a water tender assigned to their station can take the water tender with their
engine (but not in lieu of) when the water tender is needed due to limited water supply. This procedure
is not intended to provide for the use of water tenders as two-piece companies where a water supply is
readily available.
In addition to the above, a water tender may be special called to any incident where required.
Command will specify either a water tender with driver only, or a full crew. When a full crew is
requested, the assigned company will respond with the water tender plus their regular apparatus unless
otherwise instructed. When a water tender is requested with a driver only, the Company officer is
responsible to assign a qualified driver/pump operator.
If the company housed with the closest available water tender is not in quarters, Alarm will dispatch an
available company to pick up the water tender and respond.
The water tender will always retain its home station identification regardless of the assigned crews.
Example: "Engine 30 responding with water tender ( ).
Personnel assigned to stations housing water tenders will maintain and service the water tenders in
accordance with the Phoenix Fire Department Operations Manual, Volume III, Section 3. Companies
assigned to respond with a water tender will service, clean and restore the apparatus to an acceptable
standard condition of readiness upon completion of the incident.
Engineers may be assigned to water tenders on Constant Manning basis during periods of heavy brush
fire activity.

SKY HARBOR RESPONSE AVIATION EMERGENCIES
M.P. 205.13

12/12-R

Page 1 of 5

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines for the response of fire department personnel
and equipment to aircraft emergency situations occurring at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.
The procedure outlines responsibilities for both on and off airport fire personnel and details dispatch
terminology, apparatus response, standby locations, and staging areas.
DISPATCH TERMINOLOGY
Aircraft emergencies are broken down into three categories: Alert 1, Alert 2 and Alert 3. These
categories are defined by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to provide standard descriptions
and terminology for aircraft emergencies.
Alert 1: Indicates an aircraft is having minor difficulties (i.e., minor oil leak; one engine out on a three or
four-engine commercial aircraft or one engine out on a two-engine general aviation aircraft; fire warning
lights; etc.). A safe landing is expected.
Alert 2: Indicates that an aircraft is having major difficulties (i.e., a positive indication of fire on board the
aircraft; faulty landing gear; no hydraulic pressure; engine failure on a two-engine large aircraft; etc.). A
difficult or crash landing may be expected.
Alert 3: Indicates that an aircraft has crashed on or off the airport, or there is a high probability the
aircraft will crash, or the pilot has indicated that the aircraft landing gear will not work and, therefore, the
pilot will have to crash land on the airport.
SKY HARBOR RESPONSE - AVIATION EMERGENCIES
The type of fire department response at Sky Harbor will be dictated by a fire captain at Sky Harbor
Airport Fire Station #19. The captain will assess the information he/she has received from the FAA
Control Tower or other source, and direct fire Dispatch to send the appropriate level of alert response.
In all cases, the captain will take a pessimistic view and select the alert level most appropriate for the
expected problems.
An Alert 1 = ARF Response, consisting of: Foam 1, Foam 2, Foam 3, Attack 19, E19 and BC19.
An Alert 2 = ARF2-1 Response, consisting of: Foam 1, Foam 2, Foam 3, Attack 19, E19, BC19, three
(3) off-airport engine companies ( one (1) which will be A.L.S.), one (1) ladder company.
An Alert 3 = ARF1A Response, consisting of: Foam 1, Foam 2, Foam 3, Attack 19, E19, BC19, four (4)
off-airport engine companies (two (2) of which will be A.L.S.), Support 8, two (2) ladder companies (one
(1) will be a platform), one (1) utility truck, one (1) Command Van (CV-1), three (3) rescues, and 6 (6)
additional Battalion Chiefs, SDC, NDC.

foam truck for use with fuel spills and alerts. If Squad 19 / Attack 19 is dispatched on another call, along
with E19, this causes a significant reduction of available personnel for aircraft emergencies at the
airport. In this case, the alert assignment should be increased to cover for staff reductions.
RESPONSE AND STANDBY POSITIONS
On Alert 1's -- Station 19 with Foam 2 out of Station 29 will handle the emergencies along with
Battalion19, Foam 1, Foam 2, Foam 3, Attack 19 and E19, and will respond to their ARFF staging
locations along the runway.
On Alert 2's -- Foam 1, Foam 2, Foam 3, Attack 19 and E19, BC19, will respond to their ARFF staging
locations along the runway. Off-airport units will respond to Gate 118 - east of Fire Station 29 (3949 E.
Air Lane), Level II staging.
On Alert 3's -- Foam 1, Foam 2, Foam 3, Attack 19 and E19, BC19, will respond to the crash site. All
off-airport units will also respond directly to the crash site, unless Command directs them to a level two
staging area -- Gate 118, east of Fire Station 29 (3949 E. Air Lane). The Battalion chief will respond
directly to the crash site and assume Sky Harbor Command. Sky Harbor Airport ARFF staging locations
in general are:
Foam 1 will be near the west-end of the runway.
Foam 2 will be near east-end of the runway; and
Foam 3 will be near the mid-point of the runway;
Attack 19, E19, & BC19 will stage near the midpoint of the runway with Foam 3.
Each position will be at least 500 feet away from the runway.
STAGING
The first off-airport unit to arrive at the staging location will assume staging sector responsibilities and
announce "staging." Additional equipment will be assembled in an organized manner. Command may
relocate staging as needed. All radio communications will use the radio designation "staging."

TACTICAL BENCHMARKS
Below listed are tactical benchmarks to consider for any type of aircraft accident.
1. The first arriving unit should assume command and determine if the flight crew has initiated
emergency evacuation procedures. Fire Department personnel should make every effort to prevent
an unnecessary evacuation by immediately contacting the flight crew and reporting exterior
conditions to them.
2. If emergency evacuation is in progress, assist evacuation of passengers and/or provide them a path
of egress, by discharging Class B foam only, from apparatus. Create a path through the burning
flammable liquid from the escape exit door to a safe area. If Class B foam is not available, use
large volumes of water. Protect the aircraft fuselage from direct flame impingement since fire can
burn through fuselage within 60 seconds. Ensure your own supply line. Master stream appliances
(Stang Guns) utilizing fog patterns; provide quick water in large volumes to protect passengers
during evacuation.
3. Deploy an attack line to the aircraft’s interior, without inhibiting passenger egress. Fire intensity will
require the use of 1-3/4" or 2" hand-lines, utilizing fog patterns.
4. Provide interior ventilation as soon as possible inside the aircraft. Fatalities in survivable aircraft
crashes are usually due to smoke inhalation. Use wide angle fog patterns from hand-lines to
ventilate. Positive Pressure Ventilation (PPV) is beneficial, however may not be initially expedient.
Pressurize from unburned area and provide ventilation exit in fire area. Ventilation should be started
at the same time as the attack lines are put into operation, if possible.
5. Aircraft have common attic spaces, large open cargo areas (in belly), and sidewalls that can have
running fires in these confined spaces. Consider using penetrating nozzles to reach fire in confined
spaces or any location where interior attack lines cannot be deployed.
6. Use ladders at the aircraft at the wing or other accessible points. Some aircraft may require aerial
ladders to reach access points.
7. Obtain primary and secondary all clears. Never assume absence of survivors.
8. Provide for interior lighting.
9. Request Police Department secures the scene and provides a holding area to assist in the control
of the ambulatory passengers.
10. Establish both fire and medical sectors as soon as possible. Designate sectors for both sides of the
aircraft to protect the escape routes and manage the evacuated passengers, assign sectors to
address scene lighting, extrication, treatment, transportation and site safety.
11. Consider establishing a branch level command system to address fire and medical operations
separately.
12. Ensure necessary amounts of foam extinguishing agents to amounts of flammable liquids on fire.

13. Maintain effective foam blanket to prevent ignition / re-ignition of fuel.
14. Maintain awareness of electricity generated by large aircraft, it is sufficient to seriously injure
personnel and/or ignite fuel sources.
15. Jagged metal from aircraft can cut through protective clothing and hose lines.
16. To gain access into the fuselage, use the wing area or a platform ladder truck to work from. The
optimum place to cut is around windows, doors, and roof area. Hydraulic powered tools (Hurst,
Holmatro, etc.) and pry bars do not work well on aircraft metals due to the lack of solid supports to
work against.
17. If saws are used for extrication or ventilation, arcing and sparking will need to be suppressed with
water/foam from hand lines. Maintain integrity of foam blanket on the flammable liquids. Be aware
that aircraft have numerous high pressure hydraulic lines that can cause serious injury if cut or
broken.
18. Ensure back-up crew/s with charged hose lines in place to protect all personnel who will be working
inside the spilled flammable liquid areas. All personnel working in these areas shall be fully turned
out with protective gear and S.C.B.A. face piece on.
19. Have police secure a route of ingress / egress, to permit emergency equipment, particularly
ambulances, unimpeded movement to / from the incident.
20. Do not allow any overhaul operations to take place until all investigative agencies are finished or
unless needed to suppress fire.
21. Large aircraft have oxygen cylinders on board that can explode, become missiles, and/or accelerate
the spread of fire.
22. Adopt a defensive mode of operation, as needed, to protect personnel and exposures.
23. Request the Alarm Room notify the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Notification can
be made contacting the FAA Air Traffic Control Tower at Sky Harbor Airport or by calling Sky
Harbor Communications at 273-3311.
24. Request the Alarm Room notify area hospitals, Salvation Army, Red Cross, County Emergency
Disaster Coordinator, C.I.D. Team and Sky Harbor Communication Center.
25. For off airport responses consider requesting ARFF foam trucks, Medical Support 19 or Foam 34, if
they have not been dispatched.
26. Have an airline representative report to the Command Post along with the liaison from the Police
Department, Aviation Department, and any other agency that can assist with the incident.
27. Send a fire department representative to staff the Airport Emergency Operations Center (EOC).

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines for the response of Fire Department personnel and
equipment to an aircraft emergency at the Glendale Airport.
DISPATCH TERMINOLOGY
Aircraft emergencies are broken down into three categories: Alert 1, Alert 2, and Alert 3.
Alert 1: Indicates an aircraft is having minor difficulties (i.e., a minor oil leak; one engine out on a three or
four-engine commercial aircraft or one engine out on a two-engine general aviation aircraft; fire
warning lights; etc.) A safe landing is expected.
Alert 2: Indicates that an aircraft is having major difficulties (i.e. a positive indication of fire on board the
aircraft; faulty landing gear; no hydraulic pressure; engine failure on a two-engine large aircraft;
etc.) A difficult or crash landing may be expected.
Alert 3: Indicates that an aircraft has crashed on or off the airport, or there is a high probability the aircraft
will crash, or the pilot has indicated that the landing gear will not work, and therefore, they will
have to crash land on the airport.

GL
GLENDALE AIRPORT RESPONSE
Alert 1: Response consists of one (1) Engine Company.
Alert 2: Response consists of two (2) engine companies (one A.L.S.), one (1) ladder company, and one (1)
brush truck and one (1) Battalion Chief.
Alert 3: Response consists of two (2) engine companies (one A.L.S.), one (1) ladder company, one (1)
brush truck, one (1) utility truck, one (1) foam capability (1) Battalion Chief, and a Glendale shift
commander. Should the incident involve a larger aircraft, Command should request additional
resources.

AL
ALERT 1 AND 2 STAGING
Alert 1 and Alert 2 incidents all companies shall respond to the Glendale Control Tower at gate #9 and
stage until the aircraft has landed. Gate #9 has preemption / opticom light and a Knox box lock is located
on the fence. The Glendale Control Tower has a Fire Department radio and can communicate with fire
department personnel on all hazard channels. Should a crash occur, companies would respond from the
standby location, (at gate #9 - The tower) to the site of the crash.
If traveling on the runway is necessary, do so only after confirming with the Glendale Control Tower
that the runway has been closed to all aircraft.

Dry Chemical (lbs)

Station 34

Foam 34

700 (foam concentrate)

Station 54

Foam 54

900 (foam concentrate)

The agents carried are Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) and Super K dry chemical.
(Note: a limited quantity of Polar Solvent Type AFFF is carried on Support 4.)
It is important to remember that AFFF will not work well on free-flowing burning fuels or fuel burning
under pressure. However, dry chemical agent is very effective under either of these conditions. The
AFFF and potassium base dry chemical carried on these units are compatible when used
simultaneously.
Circumstances that may require large volume foam and/or dry chemical equipment include:
1. Plane crash with or without fire;
2. Flammable liquid tanker accidents including spills with or without fire;
3. Railroad tanker incidents involving flammable liquids;
4. Interior fires involving petroleum products;
5. Flammable liquid bulk storage plants.
Responsibility
Fire Ground Command must immediately recognize that a major Class B or potential fire is a critical fire
ground factor. Initial plan development should include large volume foam and/or dry chemical
applications and should be implemented quickly with ARFF units "special called".

First due Response Areas
Foam 34 and 54 --automatic response anywhere in the City.
Deer Valley has no chemical unit--north of Glendale Avenue.
Sky Harbor Foam unit with dry chemical capability—5 mile radius of airport and reserve units valley
wide- depending on availability.
Dispatch Procedures for Units
Upon special call, the Dispatch Center will dispatch units to Deer Valley or Sky Harbor units depending
on location. Foam 34 and /or 54 will be dispatched automatically to all flammable liquid incidents. Sky
Harbor ARFF equipment will be dispatched off the airport within a 5 mile radius for an aircraft incident.
If ARFF equipment is request from Command for any other incident it will require coordination with Sky
1 (or her/his designee) to assure that FAA Index D is maintained with the remaining foam units.
For off airport ARFF response utilizing Sky Harbor units, BC19 will be provided an ARFF Captain and
Engineer from Station 19 with reserve foam trucks.
Airport Foam units are large vehicles ill-equipped for Code Three response and have poor
maneuverability in city traffic. It is essential that any foam truck operator exercise great caution when
driving through traffic and consider that ARFF units are not structurally designed for long road
response.
Foam 34
Foam 34 will respond as a 2-piece company with an assigned engine company. The engine company
will assume the identity of Foam 34 when assigned to respond with this unit.
The pumper of the engine company will be responsible for laying supply lines to be the manifold, if
necessary. If available, Engine 34 will be assigned to respond with the Foam unit. When Engine 34 is
not readily available, another engine company may be assigned to pick up the Foam unit. Dispatch will
make this assignment.
Additional Foam
When it is apparent that additional foam concentrate will be needed, Command must coordinate
through Dispatch or Resource Management on the scene for additional agent. Presently, agent is
available at Sky Harbor AFFF mil spec 3% and Dry Chemical, Resource Management, Station 34 and
contract vendor. This need should be identified as early as possible.

12/98-R

Page 1 of 8

SCOPE
Freeway incidents commonly involve multiple vehicles, multiple patients, and often vehicle fires. A
major potential also exists for flammable liquid spills, fires or hazardous materials incidents.
This plan provides specific information and procedures to be used in handling incidents occurring on
the freeway system. Unless specifically superseded by this plan, all other Phoenix Fire Department
procedures shall be used in operations occurring on freeways.
DISPATCH INFORMATION
When dispatching an incident on a freeway, Dispatch will provide the following information:
1.
2.

3.

4.

Type of Incident
Location
a. Freeway or access frontage
b. I-17 or I-10 (Black Canyon or Maricopa), Papago I-10, SR-51
Squaw Peak, etc.
c. Cross street
Direction of Travel
a. If information indicates difficulty can be expected in reaching
or locating the scene, Dispatch will send a second company from
the opposite direction.
Traffic Conditions (if known)

RESPONSE
Dispatch may receive information on a freeway incident from the Department of Public Safety (D.P.S.)
or a variety of other sources. Communications must be established early and maintained with D.P.S. to
assure that needed information is exchanged regarding the incident.
In most cases, a freeway incident will be reported by the Arizona Department of Public Safety (D.P.S.).
Additionally, D.P.S. may arrive first at an incident and may be able to provide updated information on
traffic conditions and access. Any Information received from D.P.S. must be relayed immediately to
responding fire companies.
The Company Officer on a responding unit is responsible for redirecting other companies or having the
Dispatch Center send additional companies if it becomes apparent that the first company will be unable
to reach the incident due to traffic congestion. If access problems are anticipated, or if the direction of
travel is unknown, the Dispatch Center may send companies from opposite directions.
CANCELLED ENROUTE
When responding to freeway emergencies and D.P.S. is on-scene and has assumed command, it will
be the responsibility of the D.P.S. Command Officer to evaluate the following factors before canceling
any fire units.

If the D.P.S. Command Officer does not feel comfortable evaluating these medical triage decisions, the
officer will have the first due company respond for medical evaluation.
If fire units are canceled en-route, they should not proceed into the scene unless re-dispatched. This
creates unnecessary congestion and other traffic problems at the scene.
APPROACH AND STAGING
Units responding to calls on the Freeway will respond Code 2 while on the Freeway mainline.
However, alternating headlights and rear flashers may be used. Units should attempt to reach the
scene in the direction of the reported incident unless otherwise instructed by D.P.S.
In some cases, D.P.S. may advise the best access is via the access frontage or by traveling against the
normal traffic flow. Units should proceed in the opposite direction of normal flow only at the specific
request of D.P.S. when it is assured that all traffic has been stopped. Fire units should confirm traffic is
stopped before entering the freeway against traffic.
On multiple unit responses, the first unit approaching or entering the freeway within a mile of the
incident will report its identity, location and direction. Other units approaching will then stage Level I,
preferably near an on-ramp to avoid premature commitment to the mainline or access frontage. Where
appropriate to do so, these companies may block the access road to prevent additional traffic from
entering the freeway.
It is the responsibility of the first unit to direct other units via alternate access if unable to reach the
scene. Specific directions should be given regarding approach and direction for other companies when
problems are encountered.
COMMAND
The first unit arriving on the scene of a multiple unit incident will determine if the D.P.S. has established
a Command Post. If Incident Command is in place, the first arriving
fire department unit shall meet with the D.P.S. Incident Commander for a briefing. The following should
be covered:
1. Traffic Conditions
a. Stopped
b. One lane open
c. All lanes open

PHOENIX REGIONAL

2. Fire/No Fire (smoke showing, working fire, fully involved) A follow-up report should
indicate:
a. Number of patients/extent of injuries
b. Extrication Needed
c. Evacuation
d. Hazardous Materials Spill
e. What's Burning, including any hazardous product
3. Call for Necessary Help
a. Stage additional assistance as needed
COMMAND POST LOCATION
The Command Post location should be carefully chosen for major incidents to provide access and a
good view of the scene.
The access frontage or an overpass provides a view of the scene for incidents on depressed roadway
sections.
UNIFIED COMMAND
It's important to establish a single "Unified Command" Post as soon as possible. Key agencies at this
Command Post will be the fire department, the Arizona Department of Public Safety (DPS), the Arizona
Department of Transportation (ADOT), and if freeway traffic is being diverted to city streets, the
appropriate city police will need to be party to the Command Post operation.
It's important to physically assemble all representatives at a single location as soon as possible. This
may require the initial fire department commander to search out the DPS and ADOT representatives.
Once a physical location for the Command Post is determined, all agencies should advise their
dispatchers of that location.
Dispatch centers must be advised of any changes in the Command Post location (i.e. moving into the
fire department's Command Van and its physical location).
When the fire department is first to arrive, the Incident Commander must announce the command
vehicles identity (i.e. E14, Battalion 3) and the vehicle's location (i.e. 50 feet east of the accident).
Dispatch will relay the location to DPS. Dispatch must be advised of any change of Command Post
locations.
Use of the fire department sector vests and Command Officer vests will facilitate the Command
Operation and allow other agencies to find key persons at the incident.
LIAISON WITH DPS
In some occasions, particularly early in the incident, it may be more appropriate for a fire department
representative to serve as a liaison officer to the DPS Incident Commander. This liaison should be a
temporary function and should end when all agency representatives assemble Command Staff at a
unified Command Post.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

FREEWAY RESPONSE
M.P. 205.15

12/98-R

Page 4 of 8

When the need to shut down freeway traffic is indicated, Command must make a joint assessment of
conditions with the D.P.S. and police department. The logistical and traffic congestion problems
created by a complete shut down of freeway traffic may last for hours and affect a large area of the city.
A decision to close the freeway must recognize these factors in relation to the safety of the incident.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Each company officer is responsible to research or know the location of hydrants and access to the
freeway. Water supplies and other factors must be pre-planned by the first due officers. Some typical
factors which must be considered:
EXAMPLES:
1. Early call for additional companies to handle lines that may have to be extended long
distances over obstacles.
2. Relay pumping probabilities.
3. Special equipment needs (tenders, foam, sand, diking materials, wreckers, etc.).
4. Early call for traffic control.
5. Sewers, drains, and pump stations (when dealing with spilled products).
6. Peak traffic hours create congestion and delays.
7. Access to the freeway (ladders, on/off ramps, etc.).
8. Hazardous Materials Team.
APPARATUS PLACEMENT
Whenever possible, place apparatus between oncoming traffic and operating personnel in order to
protect the scene from approaching vehicles. Warning lights must be visible to oncoming traffic.
Avoiding unnecessary blocking of traffic lanes will permit DPS to move traffic and relieve congestion.
Employ rear lights, flares, reflectors, or cones as required or as directed by the D.P.S. Traffic control
and warning devices should be left to the D.P.S. whenever possible. Communicate with the D.P.S.
whenever flammable liquid leaks, spills, etc., are present with regard to using flares.
Leave one crew member (usually the Engineer) to watch the traffic and set up warning devices until the
D.P.S. arrives. Parking brakes are to be set, and the apparatus set with the wheels at an angle to the
side.
A. Consider parking above or below (on access frontage) if the traffic conditions are such that
entry is impossible or difficult.
B. A booster line or other hose line may be employed as a rope to ascend or descend to the
freeway proper.
C. Where the freeway is elevated, a ladder is an effective means to gain access and to effect
evacuation from above
D. Only the apparatus that is absolutely necessary shall be taken onto the freeway, under the
direction of Command. The first due unit will proceed into the scene. All other units will stage
off of the freeway (if possible) to await an assignment.
E. Position apparatus in the emergency parking lane or on the shoulder, as far off the traffic
lanes as possible.

F. Do your job as rapidly as possible and then clear the traffic lanes.
G. A ladder company spotted on the access frontage will usually provide the best method of
advancing a line to elevated sections of the freeway.
H. In sections of depressed roadway, it is faster to have a company above "drop" a line than one
advanced up the slope.
I. Several sections of the freeway have no access frontages and will require laying hose for
long distances from on-ramps if a supply line is needed. Relay pumping and tenders should
be considered in these cases.

INTRODUCTION
The I-10 Papago Freeway Tunnel is located in Central Phoenix south of McDowell. The tunnel extends from
Third Avenue to Third Street. The most direct access is off of Seventh Avenue and Seventh Street. There is no
direct access to the tunnel from above (i.e., Margaret T. Hance Park).
VEHICULAR TUNNELS
There are two vehicular tunnels--eastbound vehicular, westbound vehicular. There are five lanes of traffic in
each direction. Each vehicular tunnel also has two emergency lanes. The maximum volume of traffic is 8,000
autos/hour/tunnel.
BUS TRANSIT TUNNEL
There is a single Bus Transit Tunnel between the two vehicular tunnels to service bus traffic. This tunnel will not
be in service for some time and has large fence gates at each end of the tunnel to restrict access. Gates will be
large enough to allow fire apparatus to enter.
IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO TURN FIRE APPARATUS AROUND IN THIS TUNNEL
Four access doors provide access from this transit tunnel to the vehicular tunnels (two on the eastbound side
and two on the westbound side) and are located approximately one-third of the way in from the vehicular
entrance/exit points.
VENTILATION
Each tunnel has mechanical ventilation. There are four ventilation rooms, two for each vehicular tunnel, that
control air flow. Normal air flow is drawn into the tunnel near the middle and flows to exit points at either end
of the tunnel. Air flow volume is determined by carbon monoxide readings. The higher the CO levels, the
greater the air flow. The Bus Transit Tunnel does not have any mechanical ventilation.
Each vent room controls the following functions for one-quarter mile of its respective tunnel:
 Lighting
 Ventilation
 Fire Detection
 CO Monitoring
There is an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) that provides "bare bones" bridging power between the loss of
APS power and the start-up of the generator. Each vent room provides power, ventilation and fire detection
control to a quadrant of the tunnel.

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

PAPAGO TUNNEL RESPONSE
M.P. 205.15A

04/17-R

04/22-SR

Each vent room can be accessed from the surface via the structures at the park level. NOTE: These rooms have
essentially one way in and one way out by means of a long stairwell. There are two separate levels to vent
rooms 1-3 that go to a depth of nearly 40 feet below the surface (there is only one level to vent room 4).
WATER SUPPLY
 There are hydrant cabinets in the two vehicle tunnels located approximately every 300 feet on
alternating sides of the tunnel (600 feet separation on the same side). Each cabinet has a 2 1/2" fitting
and a 4" hydrant fitting.
 The hydrants are fed by 6" water mains.
 The location of the cabinets is indicated by a blue and white hydrant sign.
 The tunnel standpipe system is a wet system.
 A four-way fire department standpipe connection to support the wall hydrant system is located on
Culver Street, 50' west of Central. Intake fittings on the connection is 2 ½ inch.
There is no water supply in the central Bus Transit Tunnel. Use of the emergency access doors one-third of the
way in from the portals will allow access to the wall hydrants in the vehicular tunnels.
HUMAT VALVES WILL NOT FIT INTO THE HYDRANT BOXES IN THE VEHICLE TUNNELS. A DIRECT HOSE
CONNECTION WILL BE REQUIRED. THERE IS NO WATER SUPPLY IN THE VENT ROOMS.
RADIO REPEATER SYSTEM
A radio repeater system has been installed in the tunnel to provide for communications. The following
frequencies will operate in the tunnel:


Fire Channels 1, 5, 8 (A-Deck)

Because of the approximate half-second time element needed to capture the repeater, the first part of a radio
message can be lost. Companies should repeat their company identity twice at the front-end of the radio
transmission to avoid loss of message (i.e., "Engine Four, Engine Four to Alarm").
EMERGENCY TELEPHONE CABINETS
There are emergency telephone cabinets located every 150 feet on both sides of the eastbound and westbound
tunnels. The location of these cabinets is indicated by large reddish brown vertical stripes on the walls which
are numbered 1 to 9 in the direction of traffic flow. Each cabinet is equipped with the following:



An emergency telephone that is connected directly with the (Arizona Department of Transportation)
ADOT Traffic Operations Center.
A dry chemical fire extinguisher.

04/22-SR

A fire alarm pull station.
A security tamper switch to alert the operator when a cabinet is opened.

The emergency telephone is an intercom system that can be used as an alternative communication system as
well as to talk to the ADOT Traffic Operations Center.
LIGHTING
Lighting in the freeway tunnels is on 24 hours and controlled by an automated system. There is lighting in the
center Bus Transit Tunnel that can be turned on remotely or by a switch within the transit tunnel.
EMERGENCY POWER
There is one emergency diesel generator that supplies emergency power to the tunnel. There are
Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) systems in each vent room that provide 15 minutes of bridge
power between the loss of APS power and the start-up of the generator. The following systems are on
emergency power:
 Limited lighting
 Fire Detection
 CO Monitoring
VIDEO CAMERA SYSTEM
A video monitoring system has been installed throughout the tunnel. There are cameras monitored at the
ADOT Traffic Operations Center.
ALARM/DISPATCH
All emergencies detected by the ADOT Traffic Operations Center are reported to the Department of Public
Safety (DPS), which is co-located within the ADOT Traffic Operations Center. The Department of Public Safety
(DPS) will notify Phoenix Dispatch Center of all emergencies requiring a Fire Department response.
For serious incidents or conflicting information, Phoenix Dispatch Center should call the ADOT Traffic
Operations Center to verify the situation. The ADOT Traffic Operations Center’s video camera system can
provide some additional information and adjustments to the dispatch can then be made.
RESPONSE AND OPERATIONS CONSIDERATIONS
Fire Department response to routine small-scale incidents should be routed through the most direct route, with
the flow of traffic. The most direct access to the tunnel is off of Seventh Avenue and Seventh Street. The next
most direct access is off of 19th Avenue and 16th Street.

04/22-SR

Significant emergencies requiring the dispatch of a 2-1 or larger should follow the following guidelines:
 The first due company should enter the freeway with the flow of traffic by the most direct route. This
company must advise Dispatch and other units of traffic congestion and access to the incident, and
redirect other companies as necessary to achieve a rapid arrival on the scene.
 If traffic congestion is severe; creating significant delays in reaching the incident site, the second due
company should consider entering the Bus Transit Tunnel. This company should enter the freeway with
the flow of traffic from the opposite direction. In order to safely reach the entrance to the Bus Transit
Tunnel, companies must enter the freeway at either 16th Street or 19th Avenue. The entrance to the
Bus Transit Tunnel is located in the middle between the two freeway tunnels. Companies approaching
the tunnel should ease towards the median lane in order to enter the Bus Transit Tunnel. The fence
gate must be opened to enter. Once in the tunnel, this company can go to one of the emergency access
doors located approximately 1/3 of the way into the tunnel to gain access to the incident site.
 The first Chief Officer should respond to the incident site with the flow of traffic, or as otherwise
directed by the first due company and traffic coordinators.
 Considerer sending a Chief Officer to the ADOT Traffic Operations Center to provide liaison for the
Incident Command.
 A 2-1 or larger will have two Battalion Chiefs assigned.
STAGING
Other companies should Level II Stage on Culver Street, just west of Central (the tunnels hydrant system
standpipe connection is located there). The first due company or Command may opt to re-direct these
companies to a staging location on the freeway or directly to the tunnel as needed.
INCIDENT COMMAND
Phoenix Fire Department Standard Operating Procedures and Incident Management System will be utilized for
any emergencies in the tunnel. The Command Post will utilize a Unified Command with other affected agencies
represented at the incident. The Incident Commander must notify Dispatch of the Command Post location as
soon as it is established.
Major Incidents/Tactical Considerations
There are four probable major incident scenarios for an emergency in the tunnel, and they are listed below.
1. Major Medical
 Access to patients may be severely limited. Access will be from each end of the incident rather than all
four sides.
 Secure access against traffic flow. DPS MUST STOP ALL TRAFFIC ENTERING THE FREEWAY AT SEVENTH
STREET AND SEVENTH AVENUES.
 A DPS liaison must be requested to the Command Post as early as possible.

Move apparatus staging to the freeway entry point or tunnel as appropriate.
Watch for moving traffic.
Because of possible restricted access around the sides of a major incident, two or more Treatment
Sectors may be required.
Have the ADOT Traffic Operations Center increase the lighting in the tunnel as necessary.
Have ADOT adjust the exhaust fans' direction and volume as needed.
A hazardous materials problem may exist--ruptured fuel tanks or truck cargo (see Haz Mat Incidents).
A fire may be present (see Fire Incident).
Protective hoselines may be required.
Additional personnel may be needed to move and carry patients over and around vehicles and debris
for some distance.

2. Major Fire
 Access with the flow of traffic may be severely restricted.
 Confirm exact location of the incident with the ADOT Traffic Operations Center.
 Route crews from opposite direction into Bus Transit Tunnel, and against traffic WHEN SAFE TO DO SO
and as needed to access the incident site.
 Have DPS stop traffic so that emergency vehicles can enter against traffic.
 Confirm with the ADOT Operations Room that the exhaust fans are working at maximum volume and in
the direction needed to control the tunnel environment.


Confirm with ADOT that the sump pump system is turned off.




Confirm the lighting system is on maximum.
Consider surface wind direction and speed in the approach and positioning of the fire apparatus. Wind
direction may make a down wind approach impossible.
SCBA's must be donned prior to entry with evidence of a working fire in the tunnel.
Victims caught in traffic congestion will need rescue and escorting out of the tunnel.
The Bus Transit Tunnel should be checked for victims using the emergency access doors to evacuate.
Apparatus should be located uphill from the drain system to avoid runoff exposure.
Ensure adequate foam capacity is on scene before initiating a foam attack.
First attack lines should protect victims and rescuers.
Second attack lines should address fire control and extinguishment.
Because of extensive debris and limited access to the seat of the fire, stang guns may prove effective for
reach and knockdown.
Address runoff as a hazardous materials contamination and control/seal/dike freeway drains.
Consider air contamination and evacuation needs of the neighborhood around the tunnel and Margaret
T. Hance Park.

Assign an engine company to pump the tunnel's hydrant standpipe system located on Culver Street
West of Central.
 Utility company lighting in the tunnel may be required as the fire/heat will damage the tunnel's lighting
system.
 Move Level II Staging to the freeway near the tunnel if appropriate.
 The Bus Transit Tunnel may serve as an alternate attack/access point via the emergency access doors.
No water supply is available in the Bus Transit Tunnel but can be obtained by hand-jacking a supply line
through an access door to a wall hydrant in one of the vehicular tunnels.
 Positive pressure ventilation may be needed at the transit access doors to prevent smoke passage.
 The Bus Transit Tunnel may also serve as a Rehab location and Resource Sector operation. A utility
company will be needed for lighting and Rehab operations.
 The incident may be deep within a contaminated atmosphere. Crews may run out of SCBA air by
walking in. A taxi/shuttle system should be considered or use of the Bus Transit Tunnel as a safe refuge.
 The Command Post may need to be established outside of the tunnel to ensure adequate Command-toDispatch communications.
 Strict lobby control and personnel accountability must be maintained.
Sectors to consider for a major fire incident include:
 Lobby Sector(s)
 East and West Sectors
 Haz Mat Sector
 De Con Sector
 Bus Transit Tunnel Sector
 Resource Sector
 Rehab Sector
 ADOT Traffic Operations Center (Liaison Sector)
 Staging Sector
 Extrication Sector

3. Hazardous Materials Spill/Release
 Access with the flow of traffic may be severely restricted.
 Confirm exact location with ADOT Traffic Operations Center.
 Route crews from opposite direction, Bus Transit Tunnel, and against traffic WHEN SAFE TO DO SO and
as needed to access incident site.
 Confirm with ADOT that the exhaust fans are working at maximum volume and in the direction needed
to control the tunnel's environment.
 Confirm with ADOT that the sump pumps are shut down.
 Confirm with ADOT that lighting is at maximum.
 SCBA's must be donned prior to entry into the tunnel with evidence of a hazardous materials spill or
release.
 Initiate diking of drain systems as needed to control runoff.
 Consider surface wind direction and speed as a factor in the apparatus and attack positioning.
 Apparatus should be located uphill of the drain to avoid runoff contamination.
 Address victim rescues and escorting of tunnel wounded out of the tunnel or to safe refuge in the Bus
Transit Tunnel.
 Address search-and-rescue of Bus Transit Tunnel for any victims who used emergency access doors to
seek safe refuge.
 Consider air contamination of the tunnel, Margaret T. Hance Park, and neighborhood.
 Address area evacuation as required.
 Upwind Level II Staging on the freeway may be appropriate.
 The Bus Transit Tunnel may serve as a safe refuge, rehab, resource, and main attack point.
 Positive pressure of the Bus Transit Tunnel access door may be required to protect the transit tunnel
refuge area from contamination.
 Utility company lighting will be required in the Bus Transit Tunnel.
 The incident depth within the tunnel may not permit adequate SCBA airtime to reach the incident. A
vehicle shuttle (taxi) or use of the Bus Transit Tunnel to access the incident should be considered.
 The Command Post may need to be established outside the tunnel and in a safe location.
 Strict lobby control and personnel accountability must be maintained.
Sectors to Consider for a Major Hazardous Materials Incident:
 Lobby Sector
 East and West Sectors
 Haz Mat Sector

4. Below Ground Fire
There are five below-ground facilities related to the tunnel operations. Four of the facilities are for ventilation
fan room operations. The fifth facility is the power and equipment room (Central Avenue). Each of the facilities
have multiple levels and go down nearly 40 feet below grade. SCBA's must be worn.
A fire in one of these below-grade facilities poses extreme risk to rescuers or firefighters. Smoke, lack of
lighting, multiple levels, and staircases all increase the risk. Such events should be considered as confined space
operations and appropriate procedures applied (MP 205.09 Confined Space Rescue).
If persons are reported trapped, consider their survival profile (utilizing the risk management system) before
committing rescue operations. Apply all safety systems as required and proceed cautiously.
If no persons are believed trapped, or the survival profile suggests no rescue should be attempted, the best
approach may be to seal the facility, secure all power, and let the fire burn itself out. Use of inert gas may be
considered to extinguish the fire.
Once the fire is extinguished, adequate ventilation, lighting and air sampling should be completed prior to entry.
Entry will be considered a confined space rescue requiring all appropriate safety procedures.
COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE
As indicated, the tunnel has radio repeater systems for fire channels 1, 5, and 8 (A-Deck). Should the assigned
channel repeater fail, on-site radio communications should be switched to the other tactical radio channel (e.g.,
channel 5 fails, crews go to channel 8). Should all systems fail, Command must establish a communications
relay Company (or Sector) to provide a communications link to Dispatch that is located outside the tunnel.

Policy Statement
It is the policy of the Phoenix Regional Department to provide assistance to people involved in
emergency incidents who may not need emergency medical care but still need support to recover from
the situation.
Purpose
The goal of the District Van Volunteer Program is to provide assistance for non-emergency activities; to
provide an alternate means of transporting family members not requiring standard ambulance
transportation, and other assistance to the public.
The District Van may also be utilized to assist fire companies in retrieving medical equipment and
paramedics from hospitals.
Operating Hours
The District Van will be staffed by fire cadets or trained volunteers. Hours of service may vary
according to the availability of volunteer personnel and the hours they may be available to work.
The District Van will notify the Dispatch Center as they go in service for the day, and as they go out of
service at the end of each shift. The Service Van will assume the radio identity of " District Van-5,"
followed by their assignment (i.e., District Van-5).
Dispatch
The District Van can only be dispatched following the request of a fire department member, who is on
the scene. The District Van is a non-emergency vehicle and will respond Code 2.
If an incident number has not yet been assigned to the request, Dispatch will assign an incident number
and will log times of dispatch, arrival, departure and destination arrival. The District Van will
acknowledge response and report/announce on scene, departure and destination arrival times via radio
or MDT.
Transportation Eligibility
To be eligible for transportation by the District Van, one of the following criteria must be met:
•
•

People with no apparent injuries, requiring no medical treatment by the fire department.

MUTUAL AID RESPONSE AND OPERATIONS
M.P. 205.17

11/24-R

Page 1 of 7

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a standard and acceptable practice for
all Phoenix Regional Automatic Aid Partners with Mutual Aid assistance to fires,
medical emergencies, hazardous materials incidents, technical rescues, and other
types of emergency incidents that are within the scope of services provided by the
partner fire departments with written formal agreements.
DEFINITIONS
Mutual Aid is defined as, any Fire Department emergency response and/or
incident mitigation assistance provided by one jurisdiction to other jurisdictions
when no formal Automatic Aid agreement has been instituted. Any Mutual Aid
assistance provided will be the result of a formal request for assistance from one
jurisdiction to the other jurisdiction. Requests for mutual aid can be refused by
any requested agency.
AUTHORITY
When Mutual Aid assistance is provided, the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)
remains ultimately responsible for the incident and must provide incident support.
An AHJ is recognized as municipal, county, or state division of government (Fire
Departments) or taxing authority (Fire Districts) granted the responsibility to
respond to emergency incidents involving fire, emergency medical, hazardous
materials, and technical rescue within their geographical boundaries. For
emergency transportation, an AHJ is the public or private entity that has been
granted the responsibility to respond for emergency transportation (ambulance)
to their assigned geographical area and meet the standards defined by their
Arizona State Department of Health Services Certificate of Necessity (CON).
PROCEDURE
It is understood that a jurisdiction or area outside of the Regional Metropolitan
Phoenix Automatic Aid Response System may exceed its response capabilities.
When the Fire Chief or their designee determines that assistance is needed to
mitigate an emergency incident within their jurisdiction, a request for assistance
can be made.
Currently the Phoenix and Mesa Regional Dispatch Centers provide dispatching
services for some departments that are not members of the Automatic Aid

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

MUTUAL AID RESPONSE AND OPERATIONS
M.P. 205.17

11/24-R

Page 2 of 7

System. In these cases, the respective dispatch center acts as those agencies’
designee when requesting mutual aid assistance.
For assistance from agencies outside of the Phoenix and Mesa Regional Dispatch
Centers, the requesting agency will make the necessary request to the respective
dispatch center for approval and potential dispatch.
The mutual aid system is designed for fire suppression, emergency medical
services, hazardous materials, and technical rescue response in hazard mitigation
and/or life safety responses with respective departmental/district resources that
have approval to respond.
The mutual aid system should incorporate emergency transportation (ambulance)
in the case of crisis or severe shortage with a special consideration that this is
governed differently. Ambulance coverage is based upon State of Arizona
Department of Health Services CON for geographical areas. Not all fire
departments/districts are CON holders and do not have the authority to share
ambulance resources. In the cases of mutual aid requests for ambulances, the
CON holder shall be contacted by the respective dispatch center for the necessary
approval to respond.
When a request for assistance is made, the following process must be followed:
1. The requesting jurisdiction or designee dispatch center will contact the
requested Dispatch to request assistance. The request must include the
type of incident, the type and number of resources being requested, the
current number of resources assigned to the emergency incident, and the
current location of the incident commander (if currently on scene).
2. Upon receipt of the information, the respective dispatch center will
determine the closest appropriate supporting jurisdiction and/or ambulance
CON holder to fulfill the request. Upon that determination, the respective
dispatch center(s) will contact the on duty, official contact of the proposed
supporting jurisdiction to obtain approval to dispatch requested resources.
3. The following critical criteria will be utilized by the Fire Chief or their
designee to determine if a response is possible:
•
•

What is the incident type and nature?
What is the immediate or foreseeable Life Hazard?

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

MUTUAL AID RESPONSE AND OPERATIONS
M.P. 205.17

•

•
•

11/24-R

Page 3 of 7

Has the responsible agency dispatched resources to the
incident? If so, what is their estimated time of arrival to the
incident?
Is a different jurisdiction closer that can provide the requested
support? If so, refer the request to that jurisdiction.
What capacity remains to protect their response area?

4. After thoroughly assessing the above criteria, the on-duty contact will make
a determination to fully support, partially support, or deny the Mutual Aid
request. Upon this determination, the supporting jurisdiction’s Shift
Commander or Battalion Chief will advise Dispatch and Deployment of the
level of response that will be provided. A 3&1 assignment will be the
minimum deployment for a Structure fire or any fire with a report of people
trapped.
5. If assistance is provided, the respective dispatch center will immediately
dispatch the determined resources and notify the requesting jurisdiction of
the status of their request for assistance.
•

This procedure does not govern Statewide Mutual Aid requests or the
deployment of the Rapid Response Task Force.

•

If an Automatic Aid partnering agency elects to respond to a mutual aid
request, that is the sole responsibility of the accepting jurisdiction. Additional
requests from the responding jurisdiction should come from within the
responding jurisdiction first. Any requests for additional aid made by a
responding automatic aid participant that would include a response from
additional AA partners must be coordinated through the regional dispatch
center and the shift commander of the requested agency.

•

Automatic Aid Participants will not be held liable in any way for the
determination to supply or not to supply, or to limit the level of response
supplied.

•

Automatic Aid is defined as the reciprocal extension of participating fire
departments, through an Intergovernmental Agreement, where resources are
merged into an integrated system with standardized training and standard
operating procedures (SOP). Automatic aid includes a “total boundary drop”
where participating jurisdictions operate as though they were a single fire
department.

•

Enhanced Mutual Aid is defined as those areas where neighboring fire
departments agree to deploy resources automatically in a specific area without
prior approval.

•

Unincorporated Emergency Service Area is defined as a region of land that
does not have provisions for emergency service delivery, except for law
enforcement services.

•

Requests for assistance by Private Fire & Emergency Service provider (RMFD)

ENHANCED MUTUAL AID
Enhanced mutual aid has been defined as an agreement between two agencies
(typically 1 auto aid agency and 1 mutual aid agency) that does not require
approval to send resources to assist in an incident. The recipient is typically a
mutual aid jurisdiction requiring specific or general assistance with fire,
emergency medical, technical rescue, and/or hazardous materials response.
An enhanced mutual aid agreement between two agencies does not bind the
remaining automatic aid agencies to this agreement. Any other assistance
required outside of enhanced mutual should go through the standard mutual aid
request process.
UNINCORPORATED EMERGENCY SERVICE AREA
It is often unreasonable to determine if a call for emergency services is inside an
unincorporated area. As a result, any call for emergency services within a county
island, will be dispatched without approval and the closest most appropriate
unit(s) deployed to a type of call where an imminent threat to life is presumed as
follows:
1. Structure fire or any fire with a report of people trapped.
2. Critical EMS incidents (Codes, Childbirth, Choking person, child or infant,
Drowning, ALS Seizure).
No area is absent of law enforcement jurisdiction, and all area/bordering law
enforcement agencies provide mutual support for the Phoenix Regional Automatic
Aid System. Therefore, units will be deployed to rescue/provide emergency

medical services to law enforcement officers automatically in unincorporated
areas regardless of distance. Alarm Room personnel should coordinate with nonauto aid dispatch centers with the intent of providing the timeliest response.
REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE BY PRIVATE FIRE & EMERGENCY SERVICE
PROVIDER (RMFD)
Rural Metro Fire Department (RMFD) is a private corporation that contracts and
sells individual fire service subscriptions in both incorporated and unincorporated
areas of Maricopa County. It is important to note that RMFD is not a governmental
agency and is NOT an Authority Having Jurisdiction. In addition, it is impossible
for the automatic aid system to know who is serviced by RMFD. As a result, a
request to assist RMFD, will be dispatched without approval and the closest most
appropriate unit(s) deployed to a type of call where an imminent threat to life is
presumed as follows:
1. Structure fire or any fire with a report of people trapped.
2. Critical EMS incidents (Codes, Childbirth, Choking person, child or infant,
Drowning, ALS Seizure).

Any request made that does not involve an imminent threat to public life safety
(defensive structure or vegetation fire for example) will be deferred to the shift
commander of the requested agency for approval as outlined in the Mutual Aid
Procedure section above.
PARAMETERS FOR ON-SITE OPERATIONS BY ASSISTING JURISDICTIONS
1. Mutual Aid units will use every effort to support the on-site Incident
Commander in a positive manner.
2. Assisting resources will always operate under the incident command
standards as documented by Volume II, including the functions of
command and strategic decision making.
3. Interoperable communications must be available. Crews will not operate in
the hot zone without uninterrupted communications and connection to a
dispatch center.

4. The first arriving Company/Command Officer from the assisting resources
will establish communications with the Incident Commander. If there is no
command structure established, the first arriving Company/Command
Officer will facilitate the implementation of an ICS utilizing a Unified
Command with the AHJ. Implementation will include the appropriate
incident organization as needed. If the AHJ is unable to support a Unified
Command Structure the initial arriving company or command officer will
establish command and become the incident commander.
5. Company/Command Officers will use the Strategic Decision-Making Model
to determine the following:
•
•
•
•

•

•

On arrival, what is the current situation and what are the factors
present and forecasted?
Is life safety a critical factor, that would require working in the hot
zone?
Does the current incident strategy match the current and forecasted
conditions and critical factors?
Are there enough resources on scene and/or responding to complete
the tactical objectives (all clear, under control, loss stopped) based on
the incident conditions?
Do all mutual aid resources have the ability to communicate on the
fireground with each other and with the Phoenix or Mesa Dispatch
Center on the hazard zone radio channel?
Are their treatment and transportation resources available and
present for firefighter injuries?

6. Ladder companies are a limited resource. Therefore, Command Officers
should consider whether a Ladder Company response is necessary and/or
appropriate.
7. Special Operations are a limited resource. Therefore, Command Officers
will review the availability status before making an approval to any
request.
8. Direct tactical radio communication with the Phoenix or Mesa Dispatch
Center is required if mutual aid resources are going to be working in the
hazard zone. This is necessary to ensure a dispatch center tactical radio
operator (TRO) is monitoring hazard zone radio traffic and can implement
Mayday procedures and resources should the need arise.

9. For incidents that do not have direct tactical radio communication with the
Phoenix or Mesa Dispatch Center, mutual aid resources shall not work in
the hot zone and work to support the AHJ resources with work from outside
of the hazard zone.
10. Breathing apparatus will be refilled by Utility Trucks from Automatic Aid
cities only.
11. Injured or ill Firefighters will be transported by fire department operated
Ambulances whenever possible.
12. The Command Officer will update the respective dispatch center with
progress reports at appropriate points throughout the incident.

RESPONSE TO POWER LINES/ENERGIZED ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT
M.P. 205.20

03/09-R

Page 1 of 2

It is our policy to respond to reports of power lines down and other hazards involving energized
electrical equipment (transformers, substations, electric vaults) for fire control and public safety. It is the
responsibility of the company officer to maintain that level of safety until relieved by another fire
company, police agency or utility company.
PURPOSE
This procedure will establish a standard approach and response to the report of power lines down and
other responses to energized electrical equipment. Power lines can come in contact with the ground as
a result of storm related activity, fire, or vehicles striking power poles. In all cases, the potential for
electrical shock/electrocution and secondary fire must be considered.
ELECTRIC SAFETY AWARENESS
Electricity will travel any conductive path it can as it seeks a ground. A direct path to ground can occur
when contact is made between something energized and a portion of your body such as your hand,
arm, head, or other body part. An indirect path to ground occurs when you are holding something or
touching an object that is in contact with something energized. This could include tools or other
equipment you may be holding or when touching a fence, vehicle, or other object that may be in contact
with something energized.
Gradient Voltage (Step and Touch Potential)
When power lines are down, they will energize the ground around them. For Example: point of ground
contact could be 7160 volts. This voltage will lessen as it radiates out from this point; for example, 6000
volts. If your feet are in areas where there is a voltage difference, you could complete the circuit and be
the source to ground. This is called “step potential.” This danger could be indicated by a tingling
sensation in the feet and serve as a warning to back away from the area. Step potential is more severe
when the ground is wet.
Key Points
• Downed lines must always be considered energized with potentially lethal current.
• Lines can reset and become “hot” or “energized” again by manual operation of a switch, by
automatic re-closing methods (either method from short or long distances away), by induction
where a de-energized line can become hot if it’s near an energized line, or through back feed
conditions.
• Power line tends to have “Reel Memory” and may curl back or roll on itself when down.
• Use caution when spraying water on or around energized electrical equipment. Hose streams
conduct current! Never spray directly into the power lines. Use a fog spray at the base of the pole.
Your primary responsibility is to protect the surrounding area. Short bursts of water are preferred
methods to avoid being grounded. Never spray water onto electrical equipment until a utility rep has
confirmed that the equipment is de-energized or “dead.”
• Electrical equipment is classified as:
• Energized
• De-energized (cannot be 100% guaranteed)
• Dead (confirmed by utility representatives after grounding the lines(s).
• PCB hazards: Smoke potentially fatal; avoid and contain pools of oil around transformers.
• Poor soil resistance in the desert southwest may not provide enough of a ground to trip a circuit
even when a conductor is laying on it.
• You cannot tell the voltage of a power line by the size of the conductor. Most overhead conductors
are not insulated.

Voltage can travel through both dry and especially wet ground for considerable distances.
Pad-mounted and overhead transformers can explode.
Until grounded, equipment can contain electric potential, which can cause severe injury or death.
Electricity can flow through the ground or other conductive objects, (fences) to point far from the
scene.

RESPONSE TO POWER LINES DOWN
• Request utility company to respond.
• Consider all down wires as “energized.”
• Place apparatus away from “down lines and power poles” and out from under involved overhead
lines that could fail and fall onto equipment or personnel.
• Secure the area/deny entry.
• Periods of high activity; company officer may choose to leave one (1) crewmember on-scene with a
radio to wait for utility company.
• In the event of multiple lines/poles down over a large area, call additional resources.
Down Power Lines and Vehicles
• Request utility company to respond.
• Do not touch vehicle
• Have occupants remain inside the vehicle
• Place apparatus a safe distance away from down lines.
• If occupants must leave the vehicle (fire or other threat to life) instruct them to open the door, not
step-out! They should jump free of the vehicle without touching vehicle and ground at the same
time; they should walk away from the vehicle with very small steps.
SUB-STATION, TRANSFORMER, ELECTRICAL VAULT AND MANHOLE FIRE
• Request utility company to respond.
• Clear the area.
• Be aware of explosion potential.
• Place apparatus in a safe location away from overhead power lines.
• Protect exposures.
• Do not make entry until the utility representative has verified that the above electrical equipment
has been de-energized. The utility representative may have to make entry to uninvolved sections to
safely de-energize the equipment.
RESPONSE TO POWER POLE FIRES
• Request utility company to respond.
• Consider all wires and poles as “energized.”
• Place apparatus away from “down lines and power poles” and out from under involved overhead
lines that could fail and fall onto equipment or personnel.
• Secure the area/deny entry.
• Do not make any fire attack until the utility representative has verified that the electrical equipment
has been de-energized.

BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS
M.P. 205.20A

04/23

Page 1 of 4

PURPOSE
Battery energy storage systems (BESS) pose unique hazards to firefighters. With recent advances
in battery technology and renewable energy, lithium-ion batteries have become one of the leading
solutions for large-scale energy storage. Buildings or facilities containing a BESS may not have
markings that specifically identify the presence of these systems. Markings may only indicate a
general electrical hazard is present. An independent facility containing a BESS may appear to be a
steel building resembling a shipping container or other smaller enclosures. These facilities may
be found anywhere. They may be stand-alone or incorporated in another structure, including
residential areas. The use of BESS to support the electrical grid is becoming standard and these
systems can be found throughout our communities.
The types of catastrophic failures that can occur in all battery systems are amplified by the size
and scale of the BESS. Larger systems contain more energy and have the potential to create large
volumes of toxic, flammable gases that can become explosive when contained. The hazards are
dependent on the design of the BESS, characteristics of the compartments containing the BESS,
and levels of fire protection systems in the structure.
In smaller residential settings, a lithium-ion battery module may undergo thermal runaway as a
result of exposure to a heat source unrelated to the battery. For example, a battery module located in
or near a garage that is exposed to a car fire can be damaged and has the potential to have a
thermal runaway event. This may cause it to liberate toxic, flammable gases and lead to a
potentially high energy ignition. Fires involving Lithium-Ion battery have a very high heat release
rate and present extinguishment challenges.
Stranded energy is residual energy within a lithium-ion battery or BESS. This presents a
significant fire, electrical shock, and/or explosion hazard to firefighters. The severity of the hazard
is in direct relationship to the state of charge in the battery. Assume they are charged.
BESS failures can occur for a variety of reasons including but not limited to:
1. Thermal abuse (external temperatures)
2. Physical/mechanical damage
3. Electrical abuse (over-charging or repeated excessive charging rates)
4. Environmental impacts (electrical surge, lighting, etc.)
5. Internal faults within the battery cell
6. Other electrical faults or system failures
RESPONSE TO BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS
•

BESS must always be considered energized. Firefighters should exercise extreme caution
when dealing with BESS and all energized electrical equipment.

Request utility company to respond.
Request a 3&1 or greater hazardous materials response.
Do not make entry or approach BESS building or compartment. Introducing fresh air may
result in a deflagration.
Isolate the area. Recommended initial evacuation distance is 150 feet. Do not enter the
fenced area. The exception to this is a savable life/known rescue.
Be aware of explosion potential and off-gassing of hazardous materials. White colored
smoke is a good indication of hazardous off-gassing.
Place apparatus in a safe location away from BESS and overhead power lines.
Protect exposures.
DEFENSIVE FIREFIGHTING, water streams are the preferred agent for response to lithiumion battery fires (Lithium-ion is not water reactive).
If a fire has not developed and only smoke is visible, take a defensive stance toward the
system and be prepared to apply water spray to exposures.
If a fire develops, take a defensive stance toward the burning unit and apply water to
neighboring battery enclosures and exposures.
Maintaining a safe distance from the unit involved (large commercial systems, at least
150’).
Response crews should allow the battery to burn out. Water should be applied to adjacent
battery enclosures and exposures (building).
The Incident Commander will make the ultimate determination regarding hazard
mitigation. The hazard mitigation plan should be developed in partnership with the utility
representative and/or responsible party.
o Through this careful approach, hazardous materials technicians may take calculated
steps to mitigate the hazard.
o Depending on the BESS type and size, mitigation steps may include identification of
the hazard, separating it from electrical supply (i.e., electrical grid or photovoltaic
system), ventilation, and cooling.
Firefighters must wear full personal protective equipment, including SCBA with face-piece.
If identified shut off the unit/system by operating any visible disconnects or E-stops
(shutting off the disconnect does not remove the energy from the battery). To isolate any
PV system and ESS in an emergency, multiple disconnects may need to be shut off.
Lithium-ion batteries that are in thermal runaway or off gassing will create hazardous
flammable and toxic atmospheres.
Firefighters must stay out of the vapor cloud / smoke.
Due to construction of the unit, thermal imaging cameras or infrared temperature sensors
may not give true thermal conditions. But can be used to identify trending temperatures.
Hazardous failure of batteries can occur from physical damage, exterior fire, or an internal
malfunction of a cell. Smoke, popping or hissing sounds from an ESS system can be an

PHOENIX REGIONAL

indication of a hazardous condition. When batteries or cells enter thermal runaway, there is
typically a period of smoke (may be under pressure). The smoke is flammable and may
ignite at any time.
Responding to a Venting ESS Product
• Evacuate the area. Never open any doors or remove panels to ESS units.
• Maintaining a safe distance from the unit involved (large commercial systems, at least
150’).
• Contact vendor-specific technical support for assistance including battery management
system (BMS) data.
• For residential units that are located inside a dwelling unit or garage, the space should be
properly ventilated with charged handlines in place (open garage door only if safe to do
so).
• Maintain a safe distance from the ESS and monitor visually for signs of thermal runaway.
A remote FDC may be present on larger commercial or utility ESS to support a sprinkler
system inside the enclosure.
• Each manufacturer will have a recommended time for a battery pack to cool down. This
can be near a full work cycle of 12 hours or more.
• Defensive firefighting, water spray is the preferred agent for response to lithium-ion battery
fires (Lithium-ion is not water reactive).
• If a fire has not developed and only smoke is visible, take a defensive stance toward the
system and evaluate the need, and practical ability to safely apply water on exposures.
• If a fire develops, take a defensive stance toward the burning unit. Evaluate the need and
practical ability to safely apply water on exposures.
• Response crews should allow the battery to burn out. Water should be applied to adjacent
battery enclosures and exposures.
Lead Acid
Lead Acid batteries are also used as BESS. These systems pose chemical burn hazard, inhalation
hazard and the risk of contaminated runoff. If found upgrade the assignment to a hazardous
materials assignment and operate electrical disconnects. Utilize full PPE and direct water
application from 40 feet can be applied to control a fire.
Lithium Ion
Lithium-ion Batteries can produce heat, toxic and flammable gases, and contain stranded energy.
RESIDENTIAL BESS
BESS are typically found as part of a modern photovoltaic system but may be present even in the
absence of a PV system. BESS systems can be lithium-ion battery or lead acid battery based. Each of

Emergency Procedures for Residential BESS systems.
If a residential BESS system is identified the following steps shall be taken:
• Notify Command
• Upgrade assignment to a 3-1 Hazardous Materials Response, isolate the area.
• It is critical to operate electrical disconnects if it is safe to do so. This will isolate the battery
system.
o After operation of the electrical disconnects it is important to recognize that the
batteries will still pose an electrical hazard due to the stranded energy that they
contain.
• Crews will wear full PPE and with SCBA Face Piece in place
• A charged hose line will be in place.
• Isolate the area surrounding the residential BESS a minimum of 40 feet. Hazardous
Materials crews will set a hot zone.
• Avoid parking apparatus directly in front of the house
• Evaluate if the Battery Pack has been impacted by the initial fire or other event
• Contact vendor-specific technical support for assistance including BMS data.
• Consider a monitoring / cooling period of 12 hours in which the battery is monitored for
signs of thermal runaway. This is a passive cooling period without water being applied.
o Direct application of water is ineffective for cooling to prevent a thermal runaway
due to the construction of the battery pack.
o Temperature readings should be taken as early as possible and repeated at regular
intervals (10 minutes) to identify trends. Is the battery getting hotter or beginning to
cool?
• Contact the RP. They will be informed that they must contact the manufacturer for
technical support.
• Command Officers shall make attempts to notify the building owner or occupant that
there is a risk associated of a secondary event including fire as a result of continued
power generation from the PV panels.
•
•
•
•

Command or their designee may make notification over the radio that this notification
has been made.
Water application is the recommended method of firefighting.
Protect exposures through defensive firefighting.
The Responsible Party must arrange for proper disposal and cleanup.

Note: All BESS contain quantities of hazardous materials. In the event of an emergency with a
BESS, a toxic environment may be created that is not visible. Metering of the environment by
hazardous materials crews is necessary as is the usage of full personal protective equipment.

PURPOSE
This procedure will establish a standard approach and response to Photovoltaic (PV) installations.
POLICY
It is the policy of the Central Arizona Life Safety System Response Council to respond to reports
of emergencies in facilities that have PV systems. Our objective is to provide for life safety and
reduce property damage when and where it’s safe to do so. It is important to note that because of
the significant hazard they present, PV installations will change the way we operate in facilities
that have them. Firefighters must recognize the existence of the PV installations early in an
incident and know the associated hazards.
PHOTOVOLTAIC SAFETY AWARENESS
PV systems are electrical generators. Photovoltaic arrays generate electricity by converting light
energy into electrical energy. These systems are always generating electricity within the modules
when they are exposed to light. Grid-tied systems can have electricity back feeding into the
invertor until the disconnects are operated.
Photovoltaic Systems are found in residential, commercial and utility installations. All these
systems represent a potential electrical shock hazard. Monsoon storms, hail, exposure to fire, or
vandalism can create damage to the system which may cause electrical faults. These electrical
faults may create a hazardous condition that can override the designed safety systems.
Firefighters should use extreme caution when approaching PV systems and the structures they
are found on.

PHOTOVOLTAIC INSTALLATIONS
Page 1 of 5

DANGERS OF PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS
PV systems create Direct Current (DC) that must be converted to Alternating Current (AC) for use
in the electrical grid; this is done through an inverter. Depending on the type of PV installation and
the occupancy, the expected voltages produced are as follows:
•
•
•

Residential: Up to 600 Volts DC
Commercial: Up to 1000 Volts DC
Utility Installations: Up to 1500 Volts DC
o Utility substations or power generating stations should not be entered and water
streams should not be applied.

Note: Once converted through an inverter 1500 volts of DC current becomes 35,000 volts of AC
current.
Emergencies involving PV installations and associated equipment contain hazards unique to
electrical systems. This includes an electrocution hazard, toxic products of combustion, and
thermal burns from electrical arcing. PV installations may consist of the PV cell, multiple cells
mounted into a module, multiple modules mounted into an array, invertors, disconnects and
electrical conduit. Some installations may have a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS).
The presence of a Photovoltaic array represents an increased dead-load on the roof structure. The
impacts of this load shall be considered during operations.
Emergency Procedures for Residential BESS systems.
When a PV system is identified it is critical to evaluate the system to determine if there is a BESS
as part of the installation. Once identified the following steps shall be taken:
• Notify Command, the assignment shall be upgraded to a 3-1 Hazardous Materials
Response, isolate the area.
• It is critical to operate electrical disconnects if it is safe to do so. This will isolate the battery
system.
o After operation of the electrical disconnects it is important to recognize that the
batteries will still pose an electrical hazard due to the stranded energy that they
contain.
• Crews will wear full PPE with SCBA Face Piece in place
• A charged hose line will be in place (1 ¾" or larger shall be used).
• Isolate the area surrounding the residential BESS a minimum of 40 feet. Hazardous
Materials crews will set a hot zone.
• Avoid parking apparatus directly in front of the house
• Evaluate if the Battery Pack has been impacted by the initial fire or other event

Contact vendor-specific technical support for assistance including battery management
system (BMS) data.
Consider an extended monitoring / cooling period of 12 hours in which the battery is
monitored for signs of thermal runaway. This is a passive cooling period without water
being applied.
o Direct application of water is ineffective for cooling a battery to prevent a thermal
runaway reaction. The construction of the battery pack prevents water from
reaching the involved cells.
o Temperature readings should be taken as early as possible and repeated at regular
intervals (10 minutes) to identify trends. Is the battery getting hotter or beginning to
cool?
Water spray is the preferred agent for response to lithium-ion battery fires (Lithium-ion is
not water reactive).
Protect exposures through defensive firefighting.
The Responsible Party must arrange for proper disposal and cleanup. The disposal
company must be licensed/permitted to transport and dispose of damaged lithium-ion
batteries.
Contact the RP. They will be informed that they must contact the manufacturer for technical
support.
Command Officers shall make attempts to notify the building owner or occupant that there
is a risk associated of a secondary event including fire as a result of continued power
generation from the PV panels.
Command or their designee may make notification over the radio that this notification has
been made.

Hazardous compounds are used in the manufacturing process to make the cells. If panels are
involved in fire, PPE including SCBA shall be worn. Exposure reduction through on scene
decontamination shall be utilized.
Disconnects must be utilized to isolate the PV system from the electrical grid and BESS if present.
It is important to note that some components of the system may continue to hold energy, this
concept is called stranded energy and can represent a potential source of injury. PV panels or
modules can be covered with opaque tarps to stop the generation of electricity if safe to do so.
Building integrated PV roofing tiles or shingles are unique in that they serve as the finished roof
and generate electrical energy. This type of roof system not only has the electrical hazard
associated with it, but they are extremely slippery and represent a fall hazard. Roof operations
shall not be conducted on a building integrated PV tile or shingle roof.
When addressing concealed spaces including the attic, consider that electrical wires coming from
the PV panels may be energized. It’s possible for the aluminum frames of panels and the metal
PHOTOVOLTAIC INSTALLATIONS
Page 3 of 5

components of mounting racks to become charged if the system has sustained physical damage.
Avoid contact with these components.
EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES
Firefighters should identify the presence of PV installations early in the incident. Indicators that a
PV installation is present are as follows:
• Visible array of PV panels
• Conduit coming from roof
• Invertors mounted on a wall or the ground next to building electrical panel
• Signage found around the electrical system
The presence of a PV installation shall be announced on the tactical radio channel and
acknowledged by Command. It is critical that everyone on the fireground is aware of the presence
of a PV installation. For example, interior companies must be aware of the potential for live
electrical power to be still active in the attic and roof operations may not be possible depending
on the layout of the PV array.
When a PV installation is present in a residential or commercial application, and when safe to do
so, all disconnects should be operated to electrically isolate the system. In order to fully secure
utilities to the structure firefighters should address the following:
• De-energize power coming into the building from utility company.
• De-energize electrical circuits leading from the PV system.
• Operate the rapid shut down switch to isolate the DC power for the PV system and confine
the power to the array.
o Older systems may not have this “rapid shut down switch” function and deenergizing procedures above will leave the circuit from the array to the disconnect
fully energized.
• Evaluate the structure for the presence of a BESS and operate the disconnect if possible.
If a Responsible Party (RP) is available attempt to obtain information about the system and inquire
if the PV installation includes a BESS. Direct the RP to contact their installer to respond to assess
and mitigate hazards associated with the system.
FIRE IN THE PV ARRAY (RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL)
If the PV array is involved in fire, it’s possible to use water to extinguish the fire after the electrical
disconnects have been operated. A fog pattern delivered at a minimum of a 10-degree pattern
from a minimum distance of 20 feet away will provide for the safe application of water on a PV
array. This tactic may only be employed on PV installations up to 1000 volts. Most residential and
commercial PV systems generate less than 1000 volts. This tactic may not be employed on high
voltage utility PV installations.

PHOTOVOLTAIC INSTALLATIONS
Page 4 of 5

As the PV Panel burns the material can liquify and can follow the path of least resistance. This may
extend the fire non-typically and cause extension below the panels and in the structure. Overhaul
efforts must address this risk.
PV installations are becoming common in parking lots for electrical generation and to provide
covered parking. It’s critical in the event of a car fire in one of these systems to operate the
electrical disconnects that feed the system. These systems are an example of where the decision
to apply water to the panels may need to be made. It is mandatory to operate the disconnects
prior to the application of water. These installations represent a unique hazard as the modules are
overhead.
PHOTOVOLTAIC GENERATING STATIONS (UTILITY SUBSTATIONS)
In large utility substation events, we will not engage in any activities related to fire suppression
inside the facility. We will simply isolate the area. All fire department personnel will remain outside
the fence line and protect exposures as needed. Careful coordination with the proper utility
company representatives is required before any action may be considered

Purpose
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the features and proper use of portable radios.
The best means of communication at an emergency scene is face-to-face. Face-to-face
communication should be utilized whenever possible within the company or sector.
Portable radios will be used whenever distance or circumstances prevent face-to-face
communication. Radio transmissions should be prioritized and concise.
Radio Familiarization
It is critical to be familiar with the operation and position of all portable radio capabilities and
controls. This familiarity will allow personnel to operate their radio in zero visibility.
Current portable radio equipment is the Motorola APX7000XE. The front of the radio houses
both the speaker and microphone to receive and transmit messages. An additional microphone
is located on the back of the radio. The rear microphone is used primarily by the radio software
to reduce background noise in the radio transmissions, however, if the front microphone fails,
the rear microphone can be used to transmit.
The top of the radio has many of the radio controls. The removable antenna is located on the
top right.
APX radios have multiple channel capabilities. The Hazard Deck "A”: (Fire Channels) 1 through
16. The Non-Hazard Deck “K” (Trunked Channels) 1 through 16. The Phoenix Police channels are
also located in the radio programming, amongst additional channels that allow seamless
interoperability with many outside agencies when needed.
The channel selector knob is located immediately next to the antenna. Turning the channel
selector switch clockwise enables the user to access channels 1 through 16. Channel 16 on both
the “A” and “K” decks are programmed with the same information as the Channel 1 position on
the respective deck. A1 and A16 are both programmed as Fire Channel 1. K1 and K16 are both
programmed as Fire “K” Deck 1. In the event you are unable to determine what channel you are
operating on, completely spinning the dial either direction will place you on Channel 1 where a
dispatcher is always staffed.
A small black toggle switch at the base of the channel selector knob will lock or unlock the
programmed buttons. When the switch is to the right in the lock position, you will not be able
to use any of the side buttons with the exception of the Push-To Talk (PTT) button.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES
M.P. 205.21

Portable Radios

Page 2 of 5

The flat selector switch or toggle switch adjacent to the channel selection knob allows the user
to switch between hazard deck (RED) "A,” the non-hazard deck (YELLOW) "K,” and the Phoenix
Police (BLUE) “A” deck patrol channels.
The on/off/volume selector switch is the second knob from the antenna. The knob will turn the
radio on or off and control the radio volume. Turning this knob clockwise turns the radio on and
increases radio volume.
Between the antenna and the channel selector knob is the orange emergency traffic button.
Depressing this button sends an emergency traffic signal to the dispatch center identifying the
unit ID of the portable radio. Dispatch will contact the unit to verify/confirm emergency traffic
transmission.
The left side of the radio (as the user faces the speaker) has several buttons; the top button
(purple) is the backlight button. Depressing this button will illuminate the screen to display the
current channel. The long vertical button is the push-to-talk (PTT). This button must be
depressed to transmit radio messages. The radio cannot receive messages while this button is
depressed. Below the PTT button are the channel zone up and channel zone down buttons.
Depressing these buttons will cycle the zone of channels that the radio is on. When you reach
the desired zone, release the button and the zone will lock to that selected zone. Then you can
change to the correct channel as needed.
Turning the radio off and then on again will reset the radio to the zone that is selected on the
top of the radio on the multi-colored sticker. Simply change that selector to the correct default
zone that you wish to be on.
The right side of the radio is equipped with contacts for a remote mic (RSM). The recognized
best practice is to place the radio in your turnout coat pocket and use an RSM remote mic
clipped to your turnout coat to protect the radio from the environment whenever possible
The battery can be removed by pressing the release tabs on both the left and right side of the
battery.
Radio Operation
All operations members will have a portable radio assigned for their use. Each member will be
responsible for the security, proper use and maintenance of their radio. All radios should be
checked for proper operation at the beginning of each shift/whenever necessary. Radios not
functioning properly should be red tagged and the PFD Service Desk (602-261-8030 Option 1)

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES
M.P. 205.21

Portable Radios
05/18

Page 3 of 5

should be notified. Any radios unaccounted for must be reported immediately with a Police
Report and LSD form completed before a replacement can be issued.
Each member is responsible to carry their assigned radio on all emergency incidents. At other
times the radio will be carried at their discretion or secured in the fire vehicle.
The Captain or designee should ensure that each member is rostered into the MCT and
attached to the proper radio positon. Each apparatus has assigned radios and positions that are
coded into the CAD dispatch system for safety and accountability. It is important that when a
member is using a radio, they are using the radio they have been assigned in the MCT roster.
Battery status should be checked on a daily basis. A flashing green/yellow light on the vehicle
charger indicates that the batteries need reconditioning and the battery should be exchanged
with a fully charged battery from the station charger, and the old battery placed into the
station charger for reconditioning.
The use of the order model is required when transmitting or receiving messages.
Portable radio identification is as follows:
•
•
•
•

Engine 1 or Ladder 1 will apply to the Captain of the Fire Company.
Pump 1 or Truck 1 will apply to the Driver of the Fire Company.
The remaining personnel will go by their Fire Company ID and their name.
o Example: Engine 1 -- Firefighter Jones to Command
Single person vehicles will use their assigned vehicle ID

PURPOSE
The Surgical Emergency Response Team (SERT) is a resource that can be called upon by on scene
personnel when they encounter a patient who requires life or limb saving procedures which exceed the
capabilities of the EMS personnel on scene service or who cannot be extricated and transported in a
reasonable amount of time from the scene to definitive treatment.
GUIDING PRINCIPLES
In general, a SERT is utilized in a situation where a life-saving procedure, such as an amputation, is
required due to the inability to extricate a patient. Life before limb concept is utilized as a life-saving
measure, not as a time saving measure.
SERT should be assembled and ready to respond within thirty (30) minutes of a request with standard
life-saving equipment.
POLICY
The Incident Commander, in consultation with the treatment/rescue sector on scene will be the
responsible person to activate the Surgical Emergency Response Team (SERT) by calling the Phoenix
or Mesa Fire Regional Dispatch Center and asking the surgical team to be mobilized). The Phoenix
and Mesa Fire Regional Dispatch Centers have a contact list of qualified SERT members capable of
deployment upon request of the Incident Commander.
First on scene unit ALS/BLS, which determines an advance medical need can start the SERT process.
While not required, if the first on-scene units are not comfortable making the decision, the agency
Medical Directors (or on-line Medical Control) should be in the decision-making process.
A second Command Officer will be added to all incidents where the SERT is requested. This should be
the next closest Command Officer as assigned by the dispatching Alarm Room.
The Phoenix or Mesa Fire Regional Dispatch Tactical Radio Operator (TRO) will then contact the
assigned Trauma center via the predetermined facility activation process and ask for the team to
prepare to be transported to the scene. See appendix attached.
The TRO will then send the closest available Battalion Chief to the trauma center closest to the incident
to pick up the team and transport them to the scene of the incident.
The Battalion Chief will be responsible for escorting the team to the scene and assuring scene and
surgical team safety. The Battalion Chief will provide a safety brief to the surgical team enroute to the
scene. The BC will get the on scene Medical Lead in direct contact via phone or radio with the onboard

SERT physician to be inform of patient condition, the plan in progress and what they will need from the
SERT on arrival.
The Battalion Chief will announce to the Incident Commander the arrival of the SERT and then
introduce the SERT to the treatment/rescue sector on scene who will in turn direct them to the patient
and provide a debrief on the scenario.
On arrival the SERT will establish Medical Direction and will work under the Incident Command
as patient treatment, extrication, and transport is in process. Chain of Command will be followed
by all members at incident. The surgeon or EMS physician from the SERT will then assume control of
patient care at the scene and during patient transportation to the hospital.
The Fire Department personnel will assist the SERT with procedures and interventions that are in their
standard EMS protocol. The SERT will be responsible for performing any procedures out of scope of
practice or protocol for the EMS agency on scene. Fire Department personnel and SERT members will
work together to provide life and limb saving procedures. Medical Direction (SERT) and Fire
Department will have joint responsibility for patient care, transport, and transfer. The appropriate
dispatch center will determine the closest most appropriate SERT to deploy and shall dispatch a
Battalion Chief to that location. After the patient is stabilized at the scene, hospital destination will be
determined by the treating physician.
GUIDELINES
The SERT shall be compromised of a Trauma Surgeon or EMS Physician, with the addition of a
trauma nurse being at the discretion of the responding physician.
It is the responsibility of all responding hospital personnel to have appropriate personal protective
equipment (PPE). This may include steel toe shoes/boots, helmet, eye protection, dust masks, work
gloves and sturdy clothing, such as long sleeves and BDU style pants. Scrubs should not be worn
once on the scene of the incident. The Fire Department may provide specialized PPE if possible as
indicated by the factors of the incident.
Each Trauma hospital is responsible to outfit the kits as outlined below and ensure the kits are stocked
and up to date.
Trauma surgeons, EMS Physicians (and nurses if part of the deployment team) and hospitals agree to
participate in a yearly, at minimum or as necessary, technical rescue drills. They also agree that the
surgeons, physicians, and nurses will commit to 24 hour/365 day availability based on a predetermined
call schedule.

These operations often also require a dedicated Battalion Chief. If the decision is made to bring in a
helicopter or ground-based hospital team, another Battalion Chief will need to be dedicated to the
function of safe transport of the team to the scene. Battalion Chief Vehicles can only provide
transportation for two SERT personnel.
If field amputation is required, it is preferred for this skill to be performed by a physician when possible.
Physicians who may perform this include a trauma surgeon or EMS physician trained in field
amputation and the provision of critical care medicine in austere environments.
It is absolutely essential that any hospital-based resources be provided a safe operation. Very few of
the responding hospital personnel have experience working or responding to a field call. The personnel
and their supplies must be guided/protected/shielded to allow them to do the specific functions they
need to do while being protected from scene hazards. That should all be prepared before they arrive,
to include any need for a safe landing area; rapid transport to the patient; any necessary equipment for
a safe platform to work on; lighting, ventilation, and physical access to the patient; a patient as
prepared as possible including monitor, oxygen, tourniquet, IV or IO access, backboard and stretcher,
clean plastic bag(s) for an amputated extremity and ice to put around it if needed, and a staged
transport unit. This will allow the team to immediately assess the patient, provide anesthesia/analgesia
as indicated, and perform any necessary intervention.
The standard life-saving equipment referenced below shall be predetermined, preassembled, readily
available, clearly labeled, and stored in a predetermined location. Based upon the magnitude and
nature of the incident, the standard life-saving equipment may require augmentation.
In some instances, an extricated patient may require rapid transport to a trauma center followed by
delayed transport of the cooled body part when it is eventually freed. The treating physician in
collaboration with on scene personnel will determine if body part is salvageable.
The charting paramedic will be responsible for documentation related to patient care at the scene. This
will include all relevant pre-hospital care (IV placement, medication(s) administered, intubations, etc.)
and surgical care in the field, including, but not limited to, arrival of surgical team, description of the
surgical procedure(s) performed to free the patient, tourniquet application, etc.). Most of these
incidents will require a debriefing session for scene personnel.
The SERT will need to communicate as early as possible with the closest most appropriate trauma
center, to allow the hospital to be prepared for the incoming patient. Appropriate documentation of
patient care will be completed by the treating SERT physician any time they provide care outside of the
hospital during these scenarios. Any required hospital documentation will primarily be the responsibility
of the treating SERT physician.

SERT should consider and plan for extended operations when deployed to this type of call. Additional
SERT resources should be placed on alert in the event operations extend beyond a reasonable work
cycle as determined by the conditions specific to the incident (Phoenix Regional Standard Operating
Procedure, 202.08, Rehabilitation Sector).
At a minimum, the items below are required. This list should assist the hospital staff in assembling and
accounting for this unusual incident. This list would also allow staff to record what was returned to the
hospital. It is the responsibility of the hospitals to restock any items, including medications, from the
SERT cache used during the incident.
Note: Equipment and medications included in the list below represent best known recommendations.
The equipment and medications lists are subject to change as needed to address the needs of the
patient.

This policy is for internal use only and does not expand an employee’s legal duty or civil
liability in any way. This policy should not be construed as creating a duty to act or a higher
duty of care, with respect to third party civil claims against employees or the Phoenix Fire
Department (PFD). Remedies for violations of this policy, if proven, are limited to
administrative disciplinary action against PFD employees.

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish the capabilities and functions of non-traditional units
and define their role in regional response. Defining the role of each unit will allow incident
commanders, dispatchers, and company officers to call for and deploy the appropriate resource
who can best accomplish the operational need.
POLICY
The following definitions will serve to outline the capabilities and functions of the non-traditional
resources operating throughout the automatic-aid system. The Central Arizona Life Safety System
Response Council requires that all fire stations have at least one NFPA 1710 compliant fire engine
company in every fire station. This procedure is not intended to limit the scope of non-traditional
units when individuals with sufficient training, certifications, and PPE are available to meet a
critical operational need.
MEDICAL RESPONSE UNIT (MR)
MRs are fully staffed 4-person crews with a qualified engineer and company officer. These units
primarily respond to medical calls and can fulfill all normal EMS response requirements based on
the unit’s level of EMS certification (ALS/BLS). On fire incidents, a MR can be used to supplement
general firefighting duties as assigned by command. MRs cannot replace an engine, ladder, or
squad company for fire suppression, rescue, and special operations type incidents.
• Staffing: 4-person crew including two firefighters, one engineer and one captain.
• Hazard Zone Capability: All crew members are trained firefighters and can operate in a
hazard zone.
• EMS Capability: Primarily staffed as an ALS unit but can be staffed BLS when personnel
limitations dictate.

COMPANY FUNCTIONS & DEPLOYMENT OF MR & LA UNITS
Page 1 of 3

•

Limitations: MRs utilize a smaller vehicle than a traditional fire engine or ladder. These
smaller units provide less protection when operating near moving traffic. Company officers
and incident commanders should consider a back-up unit to support MRs operating under
these conditions. MRs do not carry hose, water or ladders; this means the personnel can
support firefighting operations, but the vehicle will have limited usefulness.

MR Units may only respond to incidents without the support of another unit on the following
nature code categories: BLS, ALS, SERV and MISC SERVICE.
LOW ACUITY UNITS (LA)
LA units are staffed by 2-person crews that are trained firefighters. LA units primarily respond to
low acuity incidents when a four-person crew may not be required. These units offer limited
capabilities to respond to critical emergency incidents and should be backed up by an Engine,
Ladder, or Squad (all hazards company) when the incident dictates. LA units may respond to fires
in certain jurisdictions but should only be assigned by command to support an appropriately
staffed, NFPA 1710 compliant, 4-person fire company when conducting firefighting operations. LA
units can be assigned in the same way a 2-person rescue unit operates on the fireground.
• Staffing: 2-person crew that varies in certifications and rank.
• EMS Capability: May have ALS or BLS members but only fulfills the personnel requirement
for low acuity BLS calls.
• Limitations: LA units will not usually have a company officer and should be supervised by
another unit when operating on large incidents. LA units are designed to meet very low
acuity needs and should be backed-up by personnel or an appropriate all-hazards unit if an
LA is assigned to any other task.
LA Units may only respond to low acuity type incidents without the support of another unit on the
following nature codes:

***The list above represents nature codes for which an LA Unit may respond if personnel have
the proper training and equipment. Decisions regarding which nature codes from the list above
an LA Unit can respond to will be made by the individual Fire Department.
MR & LA UNIT FUNCTION WITHIN AUTOMATIC AID
The automatic aid agreement establishes that participating departments deploy the closest most
appropriate resources to emergencies, regardless of municipal boundaries. Also, the automatic
aid agreement allows some flexibility for the deployment of specialized units when predefined by
Phoenix Regional Standard Operating Procedures.
The Central Arizona Life Safety System Response Council allows the establishment of predefined
response areas for MR and LA Units within municipal boundaries. MR and LA Units are required
to be deployed across these predefined municipal boundaries when they are the closest unit to a
type of call where an imminent threat to life is presumed as follows:
1. Codes
2. Childbirth
3. Person, Child, or Infant Choking
4. Drowning
5. ALS Seizure
LA Units are to be deployed on these incidents across municipal boundaries to supplement the
response if they are identified as the closest unit; they shall not be deployed in replacement of
other units. Additionally, a gunshot wound involving a law enforcement officer is included as it is
likely that the officer will be extracted from the hot-zone immediately by other officers to a coldzone where treatment can occur rapidly.
On all the above incidents, consideration for the need of an MR or LA Unit must be evaluated by
the responding Company Officer, and when applicable, Command Officer. When the incident does
not necessitate the need for an MR or LA response, these units should be canceled whenever
reasonable. Like all fire companies, MR and LA Units should maintain awareness when not in
quarters of incidents around them and may request to add on to critical calls when they believe
their response will make a positive difference on the incident outcome.
***With Department approval, an MR will be dispatched to all MR approved nature codes (BLS,
ALS, SERV and MISC SERVICE) when the MR is closest unit.

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide members of the Phoenix Fire Department (PFD) a
set of operational guidelines intended to promote the safe, efficient, and lawful operation of
Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). This document identifies the responsibilities, requirements,
and operations of the department’s UAS program.
The PFD’s primary purpose for integrating UAS technology into its initial hazard mitigation
deployment model is to increase the Incident Commander’s (“IC”) “situational awareness” by
providing a unique aerial perspective that assists the IC in fully understanding the challenges of
a given incident in “real time”; thus, providing critical information necessary to guide decisionmaking. Ultimately, those decisions impact the risk exposed to firefighters and equipment.

POLICY
It shall be the policy of the Phoenix Fire Department to use UAS to enhance the Department’s

SCOPE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide the process and procedures for the operations and
management of any small UAS used by the PFD. It will detail the conditions under which the PFD
will utilize UAS technology to maximize efficiency and cost savings while minimizing risk to first
responders, equipment, and the community.
UAS program development is focused on strategic and tactical support of (a) emergency service
delivery, (b) planned events, (c) investigations, and (d) training.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Pursuant to ARS § 13-3729(D)(2), the city may enact or adopt ordinances or rules on the
operation or use of a public unmanned aircraft that is owned by the city. Under this statute “a
public unmanned aircraft” means an unmanned aircraft or unmanned aircraft system that is
operated by the city for a government-related purpose. ARS § 13-3729(F)(6). Per Section 2449(B)(3) of the Phoenix City Code, PFD is exempt from the operational restrictions when
remotely controlled aircraft, unmanned aircraft vehicles, and unmanned aircraft systems are
used for Fire Department purposes.
4th Amendment Protections, Privacy and Civil Liberties
It is the policy of the City of Phoenix that the operation of the UAS and all UAVs shall be carried out
in a manner that respects and protects personal privacy consistent with the United States
Constitution and Federal, State, and local law. The impact on privacy and civil liberties shall be
balanced against the governmental interests leading to a deployment. The Phoenix Fire
Department will only collect information and use, retain, or disseminate information obtained for a
properly authorized purpose.
The Phoenix Fire Department prohibits the collection, use, retention, or dissemination of UAS
collected information in any manner that would:
a. Be used or operated to violate a person’s reasonable expectation of privacy, if a warrant has
not been obtained, there is no exigency, and/or there is no consent. Some factors to include
that may create a reasonable expectation of privacy are: (1) the location is not open to public
use; (2) the location is privately owned, and the person on the property has the right to
control access to the location and exclude others; and (3) the location is one where the
owner has taken normal precautions to maintain privacy. A person does not have a
reasonable expectation of privacy out in public or openly accessible places, or in places that
can be viewed by the normal eye.
b. Involve prolonged or extensive tracking or surveillance, over a lengthy period of time, that
reveals non-public information, without obtaining a warrant, in violation of a person’s Fourth
Amendment protections. When a person can conduct surveillance with authority or a
warrant, a UAV or UAS can also conduct the surveillance.

manual.
This procedure has been written to address PFD UAS operations. This procedure will be reviewed
and updated periodically, or any time the FAA issues a new advisory or new regulation. Any
changes to the manual will be communicated as currently dictated by PFD policy. A copy of these
guidelines and any updates to them will be issued to each person having UAS responsibilities and
will be posted on the shared drive so all PFD personnel may access it.
AUTHORIZED DEPARTMENTAL USE of UAS
The primary role of the UAS is insertion into emergent or ongoing events that pose a risk to public
safety or threats to the City’s infrastructure by providing “real time” hazard assessment utilizing
High Resolution (zoom capable) cameras and Infrared/Thermal Sensors.
Although not meant to be “all inclusive” or exclusive of any emergent incident type, the
following are primary scenarios under which a PFD UAS can be requested, deployed and
utilized:

Structure Fires - Deployment of UAS to structure fires, in particular, buildings suspected of
structural compromise, i.e. roof, walls or other structural components. UAS will be utilized
during the initial action phase as well as the extinguishment and overhaul phase of an incident.

Mountain Rescue - Deployment of UAS into mountain preserve areas to verify the existence and
location of lost or injured persons and confirm the safest and most effective means of
dispatching department technical rescue teams to make patient contact and extract them from
the area.

Hazardous Material Operations - Deployment of UAS with dual high definition / Infrared
camera capabilities to identify HAZ-MAT products or concerns, containment areas,
thermal readings, and amount of product. Reduce incident time and exposure to
personnel through UAS information gathering.

Brush Fire Operations - Deployment of UAS within the City of Phoenix urban interface areas for
the purpose of developing hazard mitigation strategies, i.e., structure defense, perimeter control
(hot spots) and containment assessment. 3D brush mapping through autonomous mapping
flights. Under NO circumstances will a UAS be operated while manned aircraft are in operation.

Planned Training Events - The use of UAS during planned training exercises are intended to
simulate the safe and proficient incorporation of UAS technology during real world
deployment.

Non-emergent operations – UAS can be utilized for non-emergent use such as Fire
Investigation, Safety, PIO, Preplanning, Inspections, and Training.

PROHIBITED UAS USES
Prohibited uses may include, but are not limited to the following:
•

General Surveillance: Monitor members of the public or provide surveillance
for law enforcement purposes.

•

Lending Equipment: The UAS will NOT be lent to any other department or agency.
However, if dispatched or properly requested, the UAS, operated by PFD UAS team
members, can be utilized in accordance with the provisions of the Department UAS Policy
and applicable COA, to assist Automatic Aid and/or Mutual Aid partners.

•

Exceeding Aircraft Limitations: The UAS shall not be used in a manner contrary to the
manufacturer’s guidelines or specifications.

•

Personal business: The UAS shall not be used to conduct any personal business other
than official department business.

•

High Risk Missions: UAS will not be flown for any mission during which the PIC
determines the risk of flying outweighs the benefit to the mission. Risks may include
hazards to individuals or property, possible collision hazards, and/or loss of control of the
UAS.

•

No Fly Zones/”No Drone Zones”: Certain FAA rules prohibit or restrict UAS operations
including, without limitation, (a) within a five (5) mile radius of an airport; (b) national
parks, monuments, and landmarks; (c) federal military bases; (d) federal prisons; (e)
near, or over wildfires; (f) in, and around stadiums one (1) hour before and (1) hour after
an event; and (g) nuclear power plants. If the PFD determines it is necessary to operate
UAS in a No-Fly Zone, FAA or other appropriate authorization will be obtained prior to
UAS deployment. The PFD will actively pursue a Certificate of Authorization from the

FAA to grant special permission to operate within the various classes of Controlled
airspace in the Phoenix Metro Area.
•

Height Restrictions: Per the FAA, UAS may not fly more than 400 feet above the
ground or higher if the UAV remains within 400 feet of a building or other structure.

•

Use of UAS to spray, drop, or carry any chemicals or hazardous materials, and carrying
weapons of any type or category.

•

Manned Aircraft in Operating Area: UAS flights are prohibited when other governmental
aircraft are in the area, unless coordinated flight training has occurred with that agency.

• Beyond Visual Line of Sight: All BVLOS missions are prohibited. The UAV must be kept
within VLOS. Alternatively, if First Person View or similar technology is used, a visual
observer must always keep the UAV within unaided sight (for example, no binoculars).
However, the PIC must keep the UAV close enough to be able to see it if something

completed the departments Visual Observer course.
The VO is equally responsible for the visual observation of the UAS while in flight and
to alert the PIC of any conditions (obstructions, terrain, structures, air traffic, weather,
etc.), which may affect the safety of a flight.
The VO’s added function is to coordinate and communicate operations between the
Pilot-in- Command (PIC) and the IC or their designee.
The VO will be responsible for all aviation related communications required by Federal
Aviation Regulations (FARs). To accomplish this, the observer should be in close
proximity and have constant communication, via radio or face-to-face, with the PIC to
ensure instant relaying of information.

UAS Teams
PFD UAS Teams consist of a pilot (RPIC) and a visual observer (VO) when possible. A
visual observer is required for night flights. The team concept is established to train for
and respond to each authorized UAS mission.
Each UAS Team will, whenever possible, operate with two (2) members of the Department
(pilot-in-command and visual observer). Each member will be assigned a specific role prior to
flight. Additional team members may be needed for complex missions.
TRAINING

Instructors:
The Primary instructor(s) will be chosen by the Program Manager. These pilots will be chosen
based on UAS experience and operational knowledge withing the National Airspace. Through
training modules approved by the UAS Program Manager, the UAS Coordinator will coordinate
training based on the needs of the program. Duties of instructing new members shall fall upon
those who have the most flight time and knowledge of UAS operations. Instructors will be
designated based on experience and competency with the UAS operation and approved by the
UAS program Manager.

Training Policies:
All members will have access to the monthly and yearly training plan. Training plans will be
developed jointly by the PFD’s UAS Program Manager and the Training Division and will be
implemented by approved UAS instructors.
All deployments and/or exercises will be documented and will count toward a member’s
training. A third-party program management software will help track pilot logs and flight
hours with each specific UAS platform. Each member of the UAS program has the
responsibility to maintain their own training file and ensure the information is up-to-date,
accurate and complete.

This designator is subject to change at any time as determined by the IC, Operations, or the UAS
Program Manager.
No pilot may act as a PIC for more than 10 consecutive hours in any
24-hour period. All requests for UAS assistance will be made
through one of the following:
1. Phoenix Regional Fire Alarm Headquarters (FAHQ)
2. The UAS Program Manager
Rules, regulations, policies, and procedures in place for flights within PFD’s jurisdiction will
remain as such should the UAS provide support under any form of request (Automatic aid,
Mutual aid, etc.)
The Pilot in Command (PIC) will determine if the UAS can be deployed safely, and practically,
and will either accept or decline the flight request.
The pilot is ultimately responsible for the UAS operation, and their authority is
absolute. If the mission is accepted, the following will take place:
•
•

The pilot will announce when Air Operations is on scene.
The pilot will make an on-scene assessment of the conditions and determine if the

team communications when needed.
Normal pre-flight operations will be initiated including the filing of a NOTAM when required.

No member of PFD (or any other entity), regardless of rank, may order a pilot to:
•
•
•

Accept a mission.
Fly outside of FAA, Certificate of Authorization (COA), or manufacturer’s parameters.
Violate any rules or regulations that the PIC feels would put first responders, members
of the public, or the flight team at a greater risk than is normally assumed with flight
operations.

Should a pilot decline a mission, the pilot must make a written declaration outlining the
reason(s) why the mission was not accepted and submit the draft to the Program Manager
where it will be reviewed and forwarded to the Homeland Chief.
SAFETY POLICY
If any UAS Team member observes or has knowledge of an unsafe or dangerous act within the
UAS Program shall be communicated to the Program Coordinator immediately.
Management will not initiate disciplinary action against personnel who, in good faith, disclose
a hazard or safety occurrence due to unintentional conduct.
It is the duty of every UAS Team member involved in any UAS flight to contribute to the goal of
continued safe operations. Any safety hazard, whether procedural, operational, or maintenance
related should be identified as soon as possible.
Conduct regular audits of safety policies, procedures, and practices.
Monitor the UAS community to ensure best safety practices are incorporated into the organization.
GROUND SAFETY
•

The UAS Team will identify and secure a safe location within the operational area
for UAS launch and recovery.

•

Only mission essential personnel will be in proximity to UAS launch and recovery
activities. When operating near populated areas, the pilot will ensure that a “defined
incident perimeter” exists to limit the potential of persons being present beneath the
UAS flight path.
The pilot and Visual Observer must always be aware of dangers to ground personnel
from moving rotors.
The pilot shall under no circumstances leave any unauthorized person in charge of
the UAS controls while the UAS is running.
If it is necessary for the pilot to leave the controls of the UAS, the engine will be shut

down, battery removed, and the controls deactivated.
A pre-flight checklist pertinent to the specific UAS to be flown will be utilized to
perform the required checks and risk assessment.

WEATHER
Before launch, a thorough check of the weather will be conducted, and all members of the
flight team will be made aware of the findings.
Weather information can be obtained through two primary means
• FAA approved weather resources
• An anemometer

*Pilots will not fly in wind or temperatures outside of the manufacture’s recommendations.*
Weather information obtained during the pre-flight phase will be documented in the flight log.
PRE-FLIGHT
Team members will conduct a pre-flight assessment of the incident environment to ensure the
proposed operation is within COA guidelines and Department UAS Policy. The UAS team will
determine if safe operation of the UAS can be accomplished as requested by the IC. The decision
will be contingent upon several factors to include physical features of the area, obstructions to
flight, terrain, and the weather. The UAS PIC will make the final determination if flight operations
can be initiated. The Incident Command Team and UAS Team must coordinate before initiating
ANY UAS flight operations. When and where appropriate and applicable, team members will
ensure that all authority has been obtained.
Before launch, the designated PIC and VO must complete a thorough pre-flight
inspection. The pre-flight checklist will be utilized to perform the required checks and
risk assessment.
(The pre-flight checklist can be located in the Forms Appendix A)
NIGHT FLIGHT OPERATIONS
•
•
•

•
•
•

UAS will only be used at night if the pilot has the proper authorization/waiver in place.
UAS team members should obtain the minimum altitude necessary to avoid
obstructions in the operating area prior to nightfall if possible.
Due to field of view and distortion issues, night vision goggles may not be used as the
primary means for visual observation duties. Such devices are ONLY permitted for
augmentation of the Flight Observer’s visual capability.
Flight Observers must use caution to ensure the UA remains within normal line-of-sight.
The use of UAS Staff and the use of lighting and/or IR beacons to identify the
launch/recover areas is highly recommended.
A Visual Observer (VO) must be used at night.

DECONFLICTION OF AIRCRAFT
•
•
•
•

All UAS flights shall be grounded upon arrival of approved government manned aircraft
entering the operational air space unless coordinated flight training has occurred with
that agency.
Deconfliction shall occur by the Lead PIC of the aircraft.
It is the responsibility of the UAS pilot and Visual Observer to confirm and maintain
awareness of all manned aircraft activity during UAS operations.
In the event a non-Department UAV is identified within the operational air space, the
PIC shall notify the Incident Commander and immediately follow incursion protocols.

POST-FLIGHT
•
•
•

After landing, a thorough post-flight inspection of the UAS must be completed by the
designated PIC and VO. A post-flight checklist shall be utilized for the inspection
procedure.
Any decontamination will be performed in strict accordance with the
specifications and guidelines of the UAS manufacturer.
UAS deployment report will be submitted to Operations Chief and Shift
Commander. (The post-flight checklist can be located in the Forms Appendix
A)

MANNED AND UNMANNED JOINT OPERATIONS
To ensure safe, coordinated, and effective response of UAS resources, an accountability system
shall be implemented at all incidents where aircraft are utilized.
PFD UAS will not fly in the same airspace as other public safety or government agencies
unless inter- agency deconfliction training has occurred and both agencies have signed off as
being proficient. For example, deconfliction training with Phoenix PD “Firebird” does not clear
PFD UAS to fly in the same
airspace as DPS “Ranger”. Separate deconfliction training is required.
POLICY
•

Command will maintain resource accountability at all incidents.

•

Incident Commanders are responsible for the notification to incident aircraft,
tracking and documenting of responding unit response (to include UAS resources),
and utilizing tactical worksheets and incident action plans.
Manned aircraft take priority and have precedence over airspace.
Both manned and unmanned resources shall establish and maintain communications.
All UAS resources shall establish and maintain separation assurance standards
through the demarcation of altitude, horizontal distance, and /or geographical areas of
operation.
Dispatch will announce UAS operations during incident response. UAS operations
shall be communicated to manned aircraft at the time of the request.

COMMUNICATIONS
During both training and emergency incident response, radio communications shall be
established and maintained between both the manned and unmanned aircraft (team? Pilot?).
Typically, all Air Operations communications (manned and unmanned) take place on the
assigned Air Ops channel. For example, an Air Operations channel is assigned to emergency
response incidents that occur within Maricopa County.
A second option is the air-to-air frequency of 123.025; however, this is currently only available
on ICOM air-to-air radios carried by the UAS response vehicle.
If no communication has been established, the UAS shall land immediately upon hearing or
seeing any public safety aircraft until positive communication is established.
SEPARATION ASSURANCE STANDARDS
Operations may occur up to a maximum altitude of 400 feet AGL or, if higher than 400 AGL,
remain within 400 feet of a structure unless otherwise approved by waiver or Certificate of
Authorization.
When working in joint airspace, safe separation of aircraft shall be maintained through altitude,
horizontal distance, and /or geographical areas of operation such as using roads, rivers, or other
natural dividing lines to deconflict the air space. The RPIC shall establish direct communication
with the manned resource and develop the necessary separation clearances.
If communication cannot be established, or separation cannot be maintained, the UAS shall
give right- of-way to the manned aircraft and return to its landing area until flight becomes safe
again.
LOST LINK / GPS PROCEDURES
Lost link is an interruption or loss of the control link between the control station and
the unmanned aircraft. This prevents control of the aircraft and results in the aircraft
performing pre-set lost link procedures. While operating in controlled airspace, in the
event of a lost link that cannot be re-established within a reasonable time, a
designated crew member shall immediately notify the appropriate authority.
When possible, lost link and lost GPS procedures shall comply with the following:
•

•

The aircraft autopilot will enter a lost link mode within 10 seconds of the lost link condition
being detected, return to the LZ or other defined lost link waypoint within the UAS
operating area, and
land.
If the aircraft loses GPS, the RPIC will immediately attempt to land the aircraft in a safe

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

M.P. 205.24

•

12/24-N

Page 18 of 30

location by controlling it manually or landing at the current location within the operating
area.
If both GPS and data link are lost, the aircraft will automatically land at the current position.

EMERGENCY FLY AWAY PROCEDURES
In the event of a fly-away or other emergency scenario while operating in controlled airspace,
the designated crew member shall immediately notify the appropriate FAA authority and Sky
Harbor Aviation Department Airport Duty Manager (602) 273-3388, and provide the following
information:
• The nature of the emergency
• Last known aircraft position, altitude, and direction of flight
• Maximum remaining flight time
LOST SIGHT
If a VO loses sight of the aircraft, the VO shall immediately notify the RPIC. The RPIC shall place
the aircraft into hover mode while the RPIC and VO try to reestablish visual contact with the
aircraft. If the aircraft is visually reacquired, the mission may continue. If visual contact is not
reacquired within a reasonable period of time, the RPIC shall initiate the Return to Home
sequence.
For operational necessity, the PIC or RPIC may intentionally maneuver the UAS so that they lose
sight of it for brief periods of time. In this case, the RPIC must regain VLOS as soon as
practicable. For
example, a RPIC stationed on the ground utilizing a UAS to inspect a rooftop may lose sight of
the aircraft for brief periods while inspecting the farthest point of the roof. As another example, a
RPIC conducting a search operation around a fire scene may briefly lose sight of the aircraft
while it is temporarily behind a dense column of smoke.
However, although the RPIC may briefly lose sight of the UAS, the RPIC always has the see-andavoid responsibilities set out in Part 107, §§ 107.31 and 107.37. The circumstances of what would
prevent a
RPIC from fulfilling those responsibilities will vary, depending on factors such as the type of
UAS, the operational environment, and distance between the RPIC and the
UAS. For this reason, there is no specific time interval that interruption of VLOS is permissible,
as it would have the effect of potentially allowing a hazardous interruption or prohibiting a
reasonable one.
(See the Contingency Plan Checklist in the Forms Appendix B)
DOCUMENTATION
Each flight will be recorded in both the UAS department’s flight log and the pilot’s

PHOENIX REGIONAL

personal flight logbook. Note: the flight log and PIC flight logbook are public records.
A “UAS Deployment Report” must be submitted any time a UAS Team is deployed on a
training mission or active incident. This report will be submitted to the Operations Chief and
the Shift Commander.
MEDICAL FACTORS
The health of the flight crew is paramount and any member of the UAS program must stand
down if they feel they are not able to perform their duties.
A self-assessment of physical condition shall be made by all flight crewmembers during
pre-flight activities.
No member shall act as a PIC or a VO within eight hours (8) after consumption of any alcoholic
beverage.
COMMUNICATION LINK
The Phoenix Fire Dept. UAS fleet will use the Public Safety Broadband Network devices and
connectivity.
DATA COLLECTION AND USE
The Phoenix Fire Department will only use UAS-collected information for an official and
authorized purpose. Data will not be shared with vendors except as part of official Fire
Department purposes.
UAS flight data, whether training or incident related, will be recorded in a “flight log”
specific to each UAS owned by the department.
A UAS digital media file may be utilized as a training tool for specific units or the department as
a whole. Fire department personnel requesting utilization of a UAS digital media file for training
purposes shall submit their request to the UAS Program Manager.
In most cases, “real time” information will be captured solely to transmit “live” footage to a
Department Incident Commander or command post. Although there may be occasional
benefits to sharing, recording, and retaining visual data, this is NOT the intended purpose when
a UAS is launched in public space or in and around public property or domains.
DATA RETENTION
All pictures and videos captured during a flight will be stored in accordance with the City and
Fire Department’s Data Retention Policy.
It will be the Department’s policy and practice to record visual data of the emergent incident only

Fire Department Personnel Division, with sufficient information to locate the specific UAS file. It
may be necessary to redact personally identifiable information, or information to protect a patient
and/or civilian’s medical and/or personal privacy.
Photographic and video data that is collected will be retained in accordance with Fire
Department Policies and its Records Retention Schedule. This will be determined by the
nature of the record in question.
DATA STORAGE
PFD personnel will utilize only hardware/software storage systems approved by the City’s
Information Technology Section and in accordance with existing City policies and procedures.
All digital media captured will be stored in accordance with the standards set forth by the
TS&P subcommittee for data storage.
REQUEST FOR DELETION OF ACCIDENTAL RECORDING
In the event of an accidental activation and/or recording, the recording employee will contact
the UAS Manager and request that the UAS digital media file be deleted by PFD UAS redaction
personnel.
The UAS Manager, the Public Affairs Chief, and Legal shall review the file and affirm that
the file does not contain images that represent a breach of privacy or have evidentiary
value and make a recommendation to the Homeland Chief to approve or deny the deletion
request.
DISSEMINATION OF INFORMTION
Dissemination, outside of the PFD, of UAS-collected information shall NOT take place unless
required by law, to fulfill an authorized departmental purpose, or to comply with existing City
and/or department requirements. Notwithstanding any provisions of this policy regarding
confidentiality, or protected rights, all documents and videos related to the Departments UAS
Program may be subject to disclosure by laws related to open public records.

Operations at Violent Incidents

M.P. 206.01

01/18

Page 1 of 10

Purpose
The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines for fire companies operating at incidents where
violence has occurred or could potentially occur. The Phoenix Fire Department will always strive to
treat all patients as quickly and as safely as possible. This procedure is meant to provide a foundation
for working in any violent incident environment and in any level of complexity. Responsibility and
accountability for firefighter safety lies at all levels of an incident organization, including the strategic,
tactical and task levels.
Overview
Violent incidents or incidents that have the potential for becoming violent are no less dangerous to
firefighters than the traditional fire scene. These incidents include calls in private residences or
businesses to large‐scale public gatherings. Each incident has its own unique challenges for our service
delivery as well as managing our firefighter’s safety. The beginning of the fire department response is a
call for service typically through our dispatch center. Once dispatched, it is imperative that our incident
command system utilizes the same strategic decision making for violent hazard zones as it does for the
traditional fireground hazard zone. Having two separate incident evaluation systems for different
hazard zones is not logical. The standard strategic decision making model is the best‐suited system for
this type of hazard zone evaluation and management.
The standard decision making model for the Phoenix Fire Department includes:
1. Size up and Identification of the Critical Factors
2. Risk Management
3. Strategy
4. Incident Action Plan
5. Tactical Objectives
6. Review and Revision
This process is ongoing and continual, which requires a review/revision based on actions and
conditions until the tactical objectives are met. In these incidents, the key tactical positions are:





Triage
Extrication
Treatment
Transportation

It is possible that other tactical positions may be necessary however the above are foundational to
meeting the life safety tactical objective.

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

M.P. 206.01

Page 2 of 10

Dispatch Center Responsibilities
Most emergency responses begin with a call to 911. It is the responsibility of the Phoenix Regional
Dispatch Center to process these calls. Based on the information taken during a 911 call, the
appropriate nature code is selected for the incident. Specifically, violent incidents come into the
dispatch center in one of two ways. The incident takers can receive the information directly from the
911 caller or they receive the information secondarily from the PD dispatch center. In either instance,
the standard method of information gathering, processing and dispatch is the same. The greatest
variable to the accuracy of the dispatch nature code is the quality, quantity and timeliness of the
information gathered by the incident taker. Initial information is not always complete or accurate so
the incident takers and supervisors are trained to take a pessimistic approach to these incidents with
regards to service delivery and firefighter safety. The information provided by the caller is the weakest
part of our information gathering system. The system improves once we begin our strategic decision
making model.
In instances when the incident information provided to the incident taker is inaccurate or incomplete,
it is necessary for company officers and command officers to utilize their discretion to ensure the
safest actions. Communications with the tactical radio operator (TRO) should be two‐way
communications. As the TRO gains information regarding these incidents they are responsible to
convey it as quickly and appropriately as possible. It is important that Company Officers and Chief
Officers communicate critical information to the TRO as well to ensure that this information can be
relayed to all onscene and responding resources assigned to incident. In the case of direct radio
communications with Fire Companies and PD units, an effort must be made to share pertinent scene
information back to AHQ to close the communications and accountability loop.
It is the responsibility of the Phoenix Regional Dispatch Center to maintain phone communications to
any law enforcement dispatch center or communications system that fire units do not have direct
radio‐to‐radio communications. Phone communications becomes the best inter‐agency information‐
gathering tool to incident situational awareness for violent hazard zones. Face‐to‐face or radio
communications with officers on the street may not always be possible during the initial response of an
incident. This link is imperative to the safety of firefighters and the effectiveness of the fire department
mission within a violent incident hazard zone.

Operational Response
1. Size Up
The ability to size up an incident is the primary step in achieving the tactical objectives. This is achieved
by assessing the incident in a very standard way. This includes:




What is the problem?
What is getting in the way of me achieving the tactical objectives?
What can hurt or kill me?

The initial step in quality size up includes accessing the appropriate Police Tactical Channel, if available,
to begin listening to the incident communications. These communications allow insight into the
dynamics and complexity of the incident. This allows the responding companies to begin to assess and
plan for appropriate and safe actions. This is our standard size‐up. The size‐up for violent incidents
should include:













Dispatch information regarding the incident type or nature. This includes the type of violent
actions of the incident if known (assault, stabbing, shooting, explosives, etc.).
Location of incident and/or patients?
Number of patients?
Is there a history with this address and/or person?
Does the incident nature code require units to stage?
o If not, should that be considered?
Is PD onscene yet?
Is this a planned or unplanned incident?
Is a Phoenix Fire Department Terrorism Liaison Officer (TLO ‐ C958) onscene yet?
Can units communicate directly with PD onscene either face to face or on the radio?
Has PD defined an inner or outer perimeter?
Are the patients located inside the inner‐perimeter?
If the scene is totally uncontained, can PD begin to extricate the injured patients to a safe
treatment and transportation area?

The initial dispatch information is rarely complete. These situations evolve rapidly, and it is necessary
to assume that the information, which is initially received, will change. It is important to approach
these incidents slowly and cautiously. Over‐committing prior to fully evaluating the critical factors can
pose significant danger to firefighters and thus impacting their ability to delivery care.
Direct communications with PD is the best form of information gathering about these incidents. PD has
the responsibility of hazard mitigation on these incidents. Fire/EMS resources are support resources
necessary to triaging, treating, and transporting the injured. Communication with PD Officers, face‐to‐

PHOENIX REGIONAL

Page 4 of 10

face or via radio will provide direct information as to the containment and coordination of the location
and access to the injured. Direct communication and coordination are the most important steps to
determining where and when Fire/EMS resources can access patients in the safest manner.
A significant resource in establishing the critical factors for a violent incident is the Phoenix Fire
Department Terrorism Liaison Officers (TLO, C958). The TLO’s mission is to provide an on duty, 24‐hour
law enforcement liaison for fire units regarding any police activities. C958 is a trusted partner with law
enforcement from all levels of government (Federal, State, County and Local). Their primary mission
includes information management regarding law enforcement activities and the safety, security and
effectiveness of Phoenix Fire Department units in law enforcement hazard zones.
For pre‐planned incidents that have the potential for violence, C958 will establish communication with
the participating law enforcement agency and develop a unified plan to provide adequate fire
department support to the incident. The plan will include direct supervision and communication of fire
units as well as effective management of fire department unit’s safety.
For unplanned incidents, on arrival, C958 will establish a liaison position with the jurisdictional law
enforcement agency. The liaison is established to provide the incident commander real time
information regarding critical factors, scene perimeters, police actions and coordination of police and
fire activities. The Phoenix Police Department TLO (C958PD) is charged with establishing the same
liaison position for the fire department.
2. Risk Management
It is critical that all hazard zone actions are based on a sound risk management plan. The ability to
measure risk is only possible with adequate size up. Communication and coordination with PD is critical
to size up and understanding the environment in which we are working. This allows us to utilize the risk
management plan. The standard risk management plan that is used on the fire scene is perfectly suited
for violent incidents.




We will risk a lot, in a calculated manner, to save savable lives.
We will risk a little, in a calculated manner, for savable property.
We will not risk anything for what is already lost.

The use of this risk management plan will improve the incident commander’s ability to provide a more
predictable, safe environment to achieve our primary tactical objective of Life Safety. If it is possible for
a crew or crews to enter a violent hazard zone with appropriate police protection to triage, treat and
extricate injured persons as a part of a well‐communicated plan, it should be done. This is a component
of taking risk in a calculated, well‐communicated manner.
It is important that crews are not lured into dangerous or uncontrollable situations to save nothing or
something that is clearly lost. A firefighter that becomes injured or trapped due to uncontrolled
violence is ultimately unable to do their job.

A component of Police Incident Command is the establishment of an inner and outer perimeter. The
area within the inner‐perimeter is the Hot Zone. Fire/EMS resources shall never operate within the
inner‐perimeter. The area between the inner and outer perimeter is defined as the warm zone.
Fire/EMS resources can operate in this area to triage, extricate, and treat patients within a well‐
coordinated and communicated plan with PD. The inner and outer perimeter can be fluid and change
as the hazard changes. The Incident Commander’s ability and need to remain aware of any changes is
critical. The Incident Commander must communicate and adjust the plan based on any changes made
to the hazard zone (inner and outer perimeter). C958 can play an integral role to improving the
communications with PD. C958 has access to encrypted and specialty radio channels that are not
accessible for Command Officers and Fire Companies. C958 simply becomes a valuable technical
advisor to the IC in these instances.
3. Strategy
Incident strategy is not just meant for the fireground. It should be utilized in all types of hazard zones.
Strategy defines the operational posture of the incident. The strategy also defines our actions based on
our location and proximity to the hazard.
As in fireground operations, the standard strategies for violent incidents are the same. We are either
operating in an Offensive or Defensive strategy. As on the fireground, it is critical that we do not mix
our strategies on the incident. There should be one, over‐arching strategy for every incident.
An offensive strategy at violent incidents means entering a well‐defined warm zone (between the inner
and outer perimeter) to treat or extricate the injured based on the clearly communicated and
coordinated information from PD as to the location of the injured. This strategy involves
communications with PD, the incident commander, sector officers and other crews operating on the
same scene. This is done by considering the same elements that are critical on the fire scene; including
how are the crews entering the scene and getting to the patients, maintaining an effective exit plan
and consistently evaluating the conditions or environment. This requires controlling the conditions
within our power or exiting to safe refuge when we can’t control them. Communications is critical for
accountability and it ensures that subsequent arriving units understand the plan. The factor of
operating in the Offensive Strategy under Marginal Conditions also applies to violent incidents. We
only operate under Marginal Conditions for life safety. Units exit as soon as possible, usually when we
obtain an all clear or conditions force us to change strategy. Accountability is imperative upon exit
from the hazard zone.
A defensive strategy is defined by taking a posture outside of the hazard zone to stage until the scene
is deemed safe or to establish a triage, treatment and transportation system ready to accept patients
that have been removed from the hot zone. This strategy is taken when we have prolonged violent
incidents or during episodes that are so volatile that PD is unable to ensure safe areas or corridors for
our efforts. In this situation, our presence in the hazard zone may be detrimental to police activity or
we simply cannot plan for our safety or retreat. Again, a firefighter that becomes injured or trapped

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Operations at Violent Incidents

due to uncontrolled violence is unable to do their job.
It is possible that an incident may require a change in strategy based on the conditions and actions of
either the hazard or PD. In this case, just as in the traditional fireground, it is critical to recognize
changing conditions. Once recognized, we must clearly communicate the change and verify an
accountability process to ensure all companies understand the change in strategy and retreat
appropriately. This means removing crews to safe areas and being ready to meet our tactical objectives
from this position once a PAR has been obtained.
4. Incident Action Plan
Violent incidents are very fluid and dynamic. The incident action plan (IAP) must be safe, well
communicated and continually evaluated against the conditions and the effectiveness of the actions.
This requires an incident commander. Whether the incident commander is a company officer in the
fast attack mode or a battalion chief in a command post, the IC must manage the plan simultaneously
with the work to ensure firefighter welfare and quality care. Direct communications with initial officers
(any rank) is critical and the first steps of a unified command system. Just as in fireground operations, it
is completely acceptable and necessary to initiate the Incident Command System from the fast attack
mode in concert with our onscene PD counterparts.
As in fireground management, if the conditions and actions don’t match the plan (IAP) or strategy, or
the situation is not improving, a new IAP is required. The IAP must consider both firefighter safety and
the effectiveness of the care. Law enforcement will not dictate a plan of action to our Fire Companies.
It is the IC’s responsibility to use the information that is gained through communication with PD to
determine the best plan and coordinate that with the PD Officers working at the scene.
Communicating any changes to the IAP insures that all units are working safely and within the same
plan.
The IAP should always match the strategy. In an offensive strategy, firefighters will be actively entering
the warm zone to protect life safety while consciously monitoring the conditions. In a defensive
strategy, firefighters will identify what or who is lost, write it off and treat and transport everyone else
exposed to the scene.
Violent incidents have the potential to require large amounts of resources. Depending on the potential
and actual patient counts, upgrading these incidents as information becomes more available will be
necessary. The complication of adding a mass casualty incident to a violent hazard zone should be
considered in the initial size‐up of these incidents. Standard mass casualty procedures apply if the
tactical benchmarks can be met within an IAP that consciously accounts for firefighter safety.
The standard procedures for Level I and Level II staging are appropriate for these types of instances.
Level I staging for single unit responses with PD should be utilized following standard practices. Level II
staging requires active management by the Sector Officer with clear communications with the Incident

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Operations at Violent Incidents

Commander to best support the IAP. Staging in quarters is an acceptable option if the incident is within
proximity or for long durations. However, staging in quarters should include being on the apparatus
and actively monitoring Fire and PD radio channels for information regarding the incident and
necessary response. Staging in quarters should not delay a company’s ability to respond.
Level II staging should be utilized for 1st Alarm incidents or greater; or when it is impossible to establish
a defined hazard zone upon the arrival of the initial companies. The incident commander should
establish a Level II staging location in a safe location that allows company’s access to the scene but
remains clear of the potential hazard zone
Communications
The Phoenix Regional Dispatch System provides a direct link to all law enforcement agencies dispatch
centers within the State of Arizona. Many Law enforcement agencies within the Central Region of
Arizona are a direct connection via pre‐established communications lines. It is the responsibility of the
Phoenix Regional Dispatch System to take an active role in the managing the information sharing for
violent incidents during incidents when direct radio‐to‐radio or face‐to‐face communications are not
possible.
Currently, the Phoenix Fire Department has access to the tactical radio channels for the following
Police Agencies:
1. Glendale PD
2. Peoria PD
3. Surprise PD
4. Tolleson PD
5. El Mirage PD
6. Avondale PD
7. Scottsdale PD
8. Paradise Valley PD
9. Tempe PD
10. Chandler PD
11. Mesa PD
12. Gilbert PD
13. Apache Junction PD
This communication and coordination is critical to successful size‐up and safe, effective operations on
violent incidents of any size.
Strategic Level Considerations
In the same manner, as on the fireground, a company officer is typically the initial incident commander
(IC#1) for a violent incident. IC#1 is expected to operate at the strategic, tactical and task levels

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Operations at Violent Incidents

M.P. 206.01

01/18

Page 8 of 10

simultaneously until command has been appropriately transferred to a stationary battalion chief or
shift commander (IC#2). This is a complicated task. It is necessary for IC#1 to process all the available
information into the strategic decision making model to ensure the quality of care and firefighter
safety is appropriate. The overall incident success is greatly improved when IC#1 can successfully
process information accurately from the beginning. The best opportunity for accurate and timely
information is direct communication with the PD Officers onscene. It is necessary to process this
information with a pessimistic perspective and insure all actions are well communicated.
IC#1 should be cognizant of not only the initial incident evaluation but also the necessary actions for
the other responding units. Safely staging resources until an appropriate size‐up, strategy and plan can
be formulated and then communicated is critical to incident success and firefighter safety. It is always
easier to get companies into the hazard zone, than it is to get them out. The hazard zone on violent
incidents can be dynamic and migrating rather than stationary.
IC#2 shall evaluate the incident in the same manner utilizing the same strategic decision making model
to ensure the actions and the conditions are matching. This also increases the likelihood of a successful
incident management and firefighter safety.
Direct communication with PD, either face to face or on the PD tactical radio channel is a critical factor
to accurately managing the safety and effectiveness of fire department operations. When operating in
the fast attack mode, IC#1 should ensure that they can communicate with PD on their tactical channel
via portable radio. He/she can manage this very critical communication function or delegate to a
qualified crewmember. Bottom‐Line: If the incident commander is unable to get accurate, timely
information regarding the hazard zone or the safety of the work environment, this may require a
change in strategy and the removal of all fire crews from the hazard zone.
It is necessary to understand the mission of the Police Department when operating in a violent hazard
zone. During an active violent incident, the main tactical objective for the police department is to
eliminate or mitigate the hazard. This involves physically engaging the bad guy or bad guys and causing
their surrender or forcefully eliminating the hazard. It is the fire department incident commander’s job
to ensure the fire department and the police department’s tactical objectives can been done in the
same proximity safely and effectively. In the event they cannot, the incident commander must remove
the firefighters from the hazard zone until it is safe.
Tactical Level Considerations
Sector officers operating in violent hazard zone situations have the same responsibilities on the
fireground. They must establish ownership for their geographical position or function‐based sector and
process their own decision model/size‐up (all five steps) to meet the overall tactical objectives. This
assessment is then communicated to the incident commander in the form of progress reports. This is
standard to any hazard zone, and both captain level sector officers and battalion chief level sector
officers can complete this. As in fireground hazard zone management, the use of battalion chief level

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Operations at Violent Incidents

M.P. 206.01

01/18

Page 9 of 10

sector officers is preferred simply from the stand point that the battalion chief and Field Incident
Technician (FIT) can take a much more tactical level perspective due to not actively managing task level
operations simultaneously to managing the sector. This allows for better communications and less
distraction in evaluating conditions, actions and accountability.
Sector officers should also establish effective face‐to‐face communications with police officers or
supervisors managing the areas in which the firefighters are working. Face to face communications
should provide effective situational awareness and better understanding of the police department’s
strategy and incident action plan.
Sector officers should provide a resource assessment for the sector with concern for utilizing only
enough resources necessary in the hazard zone to minimize exposure to the violent situation.
Effectively establishing triage, treatment and extrication of the patients to a safer area of the incident
for transportation is most desirable. Limited exposure to violence or hazards decreases the possibility
for injury to firefighters or the disruption of treatment of the patients.
Task Level Considerations
As with fireground awareness and safety, it is necessary for all firefighters to be responsible for their
own safety. No incident command system or incident organization can out‐perform bad personal
decisions by the individual. It is necessary that firefighters remain aware of their surroundings, work
together as crews to ensure each other’s safety and communicate when things appear unsafe or
rapidly changing.
It is critical that all members operating in any hazard zone function as a part of the incident
organization and within a well‐communicated plan. There is nothing safe about freelancing in any
hazard zone. Everyone is accountable to themselves and their company officer. Each company officer is
accountable to their sector officer. Each sector officer is accountable to the incident commander. This
system is the best way to effectively manage the overall safety of everyone and the effectiveness of
the overall hazard zone operations.
It is critical that each individual firefighter not be lured into dangerous or uncontrollable situations
because of the police department or bystander’s actions. All incident actions must be communicated
to ensure the safety or security of areas or persons. Good intentions or an overly aggressive nature can
easily lure individuals or crews into bad situations with significant consequences. Continual
communications regarding situational awareness between crewmembers and their company officers is
necessary.
Company officers should maintain and communicate simple and effective exit plans during operations
in violent hazard zones. As in high‐rise firefighting, continual management and awareness of areas of
safe refuge are critical to firefighter safety. Once identified these areas should be communicated to the
sector officer for situational awareness and sharing with other companies working within that
geographical area.

Unforeseen or Unpredicted Violent Situations
It is common for fire companies to, on a random basis, encounter situations that did not appear to be
volatile or violent, but have become so. Quite often these situations surprise firefighters in the process
of delivering service that has been done thousands of time before without incident. Historically,
firefighters escaping without injury are usually because we can quickly over‐power a situation or
smoothly talk our way out of violence because of our good standing within the public. Neither is
reliable or predictable enough to ensure any amount of success. The most effective means are true
situational awareness and defensive tactics that limits our exposure to these scenarios.
The most effective actions when firefighters find themselves in an unpredicted, possibly violent
situation is (run, hide, fight):






Removing themselves to safety
Communicate directly with PD over their tactical channel to request assistance
o Communicating who, what and where
Utilizing the emergency traffic button on our portable radios when it is not safe to speak
Utilize any area of safe refuge or cover
Only actively engage the aggressor as an absolute last resort
o Fully commit to neutralizing the aggressor

The most effective method to ensure firefighter safety is to not allow us to be surprised or lured in to
dangerous situations. This can be very difficult. When firefighters find themselves in a violent situation
the safest thing to do is to remove themselves from the violence and retreat to safe refuge. Self‐
removal is not always easy. Firefighters should work in a minimum of pairs or even better as an intact
crew to improve everyone’s overall safety from violence. This will also improve maintaining situational
awareness for all parties involved in the incident scene.
Active management of our environment and our proximity to patients is important to our overall
safety. The key to close quarter interactions with patients is maintaining defensible space. Removing or
coaxing patients to open areas or unconfined spaces can improve our defensible space. Due to the
nature of our job, working near patients sometimes is necessary. Remain aware of their body language
and communications. It may be reasonable to sometimes only treat emergent issues as an effective
way to improve overall safety. Simply getting patients to an environment that firefighters can control
(maybe with the assistance of PD) is important to reducing the overall exposure to violence.
Furthermore, removing any items that may conceal weapons or eliminating dangerous items from
proximity of the patient can significantly limit the overall exposure to violence. It is imperative that
company officers and individual firefighters are continuously aware of their surroundings.

GUIDELINES FOR CIVIL UNREST
M.P. 206.01A

08/20-N

Page 1 of 1

For many decades, the fire service has been called along with law enforcement to intervene in
incidents involving civil unrest. Any civil unrest has the potential to cause for an increase in emergency
calls. Civil unrest events can change quickly, and we have excellent SOP’s that govern our response.
The following is provided to supplement our policies with some guidance for our response to an
incident involving civil unrest:
IMPORTANT SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS:
• No single company responses will be permitted in the predefined area (geo fence).
• All responses shall be coordinated with law enforcement and will include force protection/escort.
• Use of sirens and air horns should be avoided within the immediate area, lights may be used.
• Position apparatus in a manner that will allow for rapid, unobstructed retreat from the area.
Also, apparatus must be parked in a manner that best protects the crew.
• Be smart with regard to your behavior. Stay alert and aware of what is happening around you
and your crew. Back off and away from any potentially violent situation. Don’t fuel civil unrest.
TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
• In most cases, patients will be more effectively treated if removed from the scene to a
determined treatment area (scoop and run). A great practice is for law enforcement to bring
patients to us.
• When no lives are at stake, emphasis will be on protecting savable property. Buildings,
vehicles, etc. that are fully involved with no or little exposure problem may be left to burn.
• When safe and well-coordinated, fire suppression efforts will have an emphasis on fast water,
heavy streams to rapidly control and extinguish the fire and then to get out of the area. Routine
salvage, ventilation, and overhaul practices may be discontinued. Use of hand lines should be
limited. Roof operations should be avoided and ladder buildings only when necessary for
rescue efforts.
• All fire units will enter the perimeter as intact groups with law enforcement, travel in groups,
operate in groups, and return in groups.
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
• Any civil unrest has the potential of escalating into a major situation.
• Chief Officers will be added to all responses to provide for additional member safety in known
areas of civil unrest.
• Fire Departments should be prepared to support law enforcement partners with rehabilitation of
officers, treatment, and transportation as necessary.
• Terrorism Liaison Officers (TLO) are extremely valuable to assist with coordination of efforts.
TLOs should be utilized at the tactical and strategic levels whenever possible.
• When multiple Emergency Operations Centers, Incident Management Teams, or other similar
systems are operating regionally, information sharing amongst leaders is a best practice.

FIREGROUND EXPOSURE REDUCTION
M.P. 206.02

11/19-N

Page 1 of 3

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish safe and active practices for exposure reduction. When
operating within the hazard zone, toxic substances can accumulate on personal protective equipment
(PPE), firefighting equipment, and on the body. These toxic substances include known carcinogens.
POLICY
The Phoenix Fire Department and our automatic-aid system partners within the Central Arizona Life
Safety System Response Council have a shared commitment to firefighter safety. This commitment
includes reducing exposure to known carcinogens, toxins and other potential hazardous substances.
The guidelines within this procedure are intended to reduce firefighter exposure and contamination. All
personnel shall protect themselves and their coworkers by following to this procedure.
DEFINITIONS
For the purpose of this policy the following terms are defined as:
• Exposure is defined as a person or equipment coming into contact with a known hazardous
substance or carcinogen.
• Contamination is defined as absorption, inhalation and ingestion of known hazardous substances
or carcinogens within the body.
• Decontamination is defined as the removal of hazardous substances or carcinogens from an
employee’s tools, PPE, clothing, body, and work area to the extent necessary to prevent or
minimize exposure and contamination.
• Hot Zone is defined as the area including and immediately surrounding the hazard area, which
extends far enough to prevent adverse effects to personnel outside the zone.
• Warm Zone is defined as the area outside the Hot Zone where personnel and equipment
decontamination (and support activities) take place.
• Cold Zone is defined as the area that contains the command post and such other support
functions deemed necessary to control the incident.
• Drop Zone is defined as the area established to place equipment after it has been
decontaminated.
PROCEDURE
When firefighters are exposed to environments with hazardous substances or carcinogens those
substances can accumulate on equipment, PPE, clothing, and the body. The presumption should be the
accumulation will lead to contamination. Examples of hazardous environments are as follows:
• Structure fires
• Hazardous materials incidents
• Vehicle fires
• Brush fires
• Dumpster fires

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

FIREGROUND EXPOSURE REDUCTION
M.P. 206.02

11/19-N

Page 2 of 3

Any incident or environment where smoke or off gassing is present for any duration of time can cause an
exposure. Firefighters should be mindful that exposure to products of combustion, such as smoke, does
not require visible conditions. All types of fire incidents often include a variety of combustibles (e.g.,
wood, paper, plastics, synthetics, fertilizers, pesticides, insecticides, solvents, petroleum products, and
other unknown materials). The smell of hazardous materials or products of combustion indicates
contamination. Inhalation, ingestion, and absorption of low quantities (measured in parts per million) or
microscopic amounts can have a carcinogenic effect along with other adverse health effects.
Every member on the fireground needs to remain aware of the potential for exposure and contamination.
This includes but is not limited to members performing fireground support operations (ladder work), the
Engineer working at the pump panel, on deck crews, Safety Officer, Sector Officer, and Incident
Commander. Unintended exposure of any personnel is possible due to shifting winds, expanding
incidents, or unexpected events.
FIREGROUND EXPOSURE REDUCTION AND DECONTAMINATION GUIDELINES
Decontamination (decon) may be necessary for exposed or contaminated Fire Department personnel
and/or civilians. All personnel exposed to products of combustion or contaminants should perform gross
decon prior to entering the Cold Zone or leaving the incident scene. To facilitate this process, personnel
are responsible for the following:
1. The Incident Commander is responsible for ensuring that a decon location is designated and
announced on every applicable incident.
a. Generally, the decontamination location is setup by the first arriving engine company, or
initial Incident Commander.
2. The Engineer of the fire company directed to setup decon shall establish and oversee the process.
This includes setting up an approved hose line and other supporting decon equipment.
a. This hose setup should be established outside the Hot Zone, with enough water flow to
facilitate decon without embedding contaminants into PPE and equipment.
b. To enable decon of multiple personnel, additional decon lines should be setup.
c. Depending on the length and extent of the incident a Drop Zone may be established. The
Drop Zone should be established in a location that is downwind of personnel and may
include placement of tarps or salvage covers.
3. Upon exiting the Hot Zone, personnel should remain on-air, and report directly to the decon
location.
a. Those members with the lowest air supply should be decontaminated first.
b. Crew members should assist each other with rinsing off contaminants and debris. This
should be a systematic process working from the collar-line down; remain mindful of high
potential collection points such as the groin and armpits.
c. The objective is to rinse off contaminants without saturating the inner lining of PPE.
4. After the initial rinse personnel may go-off air using approved doffing techniques.
5. Personnel may begin decontamination of equipment (e.g., SCBA, tools, helmet, etc.) when
appropriate. Consideration should be given to wearing the proper PPE for this process (i.e., EMS
gloves and eye protection).

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

FIREGROUND EXPOSURE REDUCTION
M.P. 206.02

11/19-N

Page 3 of 3

a. Soft bristle scrub brushes and department issued soaps and cleaners should be used to
assist in the decon process.
6. Depending on the extent and length of the incident, all PPE may be left in a prepared Drop Zone.
7. Personnel should use department approved methods for cleaning of the head, neck, face, hands,
and any other exposed skin.
8. When possible, personnel should resist the urge to eat or drink until initial decon is complete.
9. After decon, personnel should cool down to decrease the potential for contamination.
10. Every attempt should be made to limit contamination of the Cold Zone. For example, personnel
shall complete the decon process prior to entering the Rehab Sector (if established).
If personnel are reassigned back into the Hot Zone, upon exiting they should go through the decon
process as stated above. Examples include, salvage and overhaul efforts, retrieving hose lines, etc.
When reloading hose lines personnel should be aware of the potential risk of exposure. Contaminates
should be cleaned off hose lines prior to reloading. Personnel should take appropriate decon steps after
reloading all equipment. Once released from the incident by the Incident Commander, it’s recommended
that PPE be bagged and sealed at the scene to prevent off gassing and contamination of the apparatus
cab.
POST FIRE DECON
It is highly recommended that all personnel exposed to the products of combustion, or any potentially
harmful chemical or biological toxins, complete a comprehensive decon as soon as possible after the
exposure. The Incident Commander may place units with exposed personnel out-of-service until
decontamination is complete. A crew member should monitor the radio in case an urgent call is
dispatched. These units should immediately address the following:
• Switch out into your second set of turnout gear and send in contaminated turnouts for proper
cleaning. Replacement hood, shroud, gloves and brim should be acquired.
• Decontaminate equipment (e.g., SCBA, helmet, mask, radios, tools, etc.).
• Decontaminate apparatus cab.
• “Shower within the hour.” Consideration should be given to taking a cool shower when possible
to minimize potential contamination by closing pores of the skin.
• Change into a clean uniform and wash soiled uniforms.
• Return apparatus to state of readiness and go back into service as soon as possible.
• Complete the Toxic Exposure form.
OPERATIONAL INFORMATION
Personnel are encouraged to carry a complete and clean uniform that can be accessed after an incident.
This is especially important to members assigned to adaptive response units. The apparatus cab should
be kept as clean as possible to avoid the transfer of contaminates. Fire companies should carry plastic
bags to store and seal contaminated turnouts. This is critical to prevent off gassing in the apparatus cab.

SUPERVISING LESS EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL
M.P. 206.03

09/96-R

Page 1 of 2

The purpose of this procedure is to describe the requirements necessary for supervising less
experienced personnel at working incidents.
The integral part of safe operations at an incident site is that the fire company functions as a team,
supervised by the company officer. The company officer is responsible for the supervision and welfare
of all personnel in his/her company and other fire fighters assigned to his/her supervision.
It is important to recognize that fire fighters gain "experience" at different rates. Experience levels
depend upon time on the job, number, type and intensity of past incidents, and the quality of
supervision and training that the fire fighter has gained.
It is also important to recognize that inexperienced personnel caught in a hot, smoke-filled environment
with zero visibility, or other hazardous or unfamiliar environment, can easily take inappropriate action
resulting in injury or death to themselves or others.
With the arrival of a new or less experienced fire fighter to the company, the company
officer--and all crew members assume responsibility for the new fire fighter.
For the purpose of this procedure, a "less experienced" fire fighter is defined as:
A.
B.

Probationary fire fighter.
Any member with less than two years total experience assigned to fire fighting duties.

It should be noted that two years fire fighting experience, does not necessarily qualify that individual as
experienced. Fire fighters may still require direct supervision.
It will be the responsibility of the company officer to determine the experience level of all fire fighters
assigned to his/her company through the following methods:
Interview:

Interview the fire fighter to determine time assigned to fire fighting duties, previous
assignments, type and amount of prior experience.

Evaluate:

Evaluate the fire fighters proficiency in hose lays, SCBA, ladder, evolutions, etc.
Determine the fire fighter's knowledge of fire fighting and safety procedures. Interview
previous company officers on the fire fighter's past performance.

Training:

Provide frequent and appropriate training to improve skill levels and maintain proficiency.

Follow-up:

Provide follow-up evaluation and training. Evaluate the fire fighter's performance at
each incident. Interview other fire fighters who worked with the fire fighter.

Those fire fighters determined to be inexperienced will be directly supervised by the company officer or
a fire fighter with greater than two years total fire fighting experience.

PHOENIX REGIONAL

Direct supervision will be required at the moment the fire fighter enters an area that exposes the fire
fighter to potential injury or death. Examples include:
A.
B.
C.
D.
E.
F.

Entering a building involved with smoke or fire.
Approaching a potential collapse area.
Potential explosion or flash fire.
Approaching a hazardous materials incident.
Entering an area where hazard line tape is present.
Any other area that could cause injury or death to the fire fighter.

The fact that a fire fighter meets the time in assignment criteria to be an experienced fire fighter does
not relieve the supervisor of his/her responsibilities. All personnel at an incident will be supervised by
and accountable to a company officer or command officer.
The experienced fire fighter, however, may be permitted, under appropriate and safe circumstances, to
function at an incident without direct supervision of a company officer.

RECRUIT TRAINING VEHICULARS

M.P. 206.03A

03/09-N

Page 1 of 3

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure to is to establish guidelines for the operations of recruit training
vehiculars. The Fire Department recognizes that recruit vehiculars is a critical phase of the recruit’s
training, and allows the recruit to experience the actual work of a firefighter. This is done under the
close supervision of Recruit Training Officers (RTOs), and it is conducted prior to the recruit leaving the
Training Academy and reporting to his or her first probationary station rotation.
This procedure will also ensure the recruit gets a meaningful experience while maintaining a safe
environment and allowing for a good communications link between the Training Academy and the
Operations Section of the Fire Department.
COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN TRAINING AND OPERATIONS
It is critical that the Operations Division is aware of recruit vehicular training and the battalions that this
training will be occurring in. In the past, recruit-training companies have added on to incidents and the
responding field companies and command officers were not aware of their presence. This can lead to
confusion and could be dangerous to the recruits.
The responsibility of notification to Operations of any vehicular training from the Phoenix Fire
Department Regional Training Academy (TA) will be the Division Chief of Training. The Division Chief
of Training will notify the North, South and West Shift Commanders on all three shifts, via e-mail or
telephone, of the dates and times that vehicular training will be conducted.
In addition, the Division Chief of Training will place a notice in the Buckslip and through department email and notify all members of the dates and times that vehicular training will be conducted. This
should be done at least one week prior to the date of the training. The training companies should use
the vehicle designation of Engines 96 through 99. These vehicle numbers are reserved for the TA and
are recognized throughout the automatic aid system as training crews.
The RTOs of the individual training companies will notify the specific Battalion Chiefs of the battalions
that the training vehicles will be operating in. For instance, if the vehicular engine will be operating in
Station 30’s first due, the RTO will notify by phone Battalion 8 and advise the Battalion Chief of the
plans to train in that area.
The RTO also needs to contact the captain of the Engine and/or Ladder Company and inform them of
the recruit-training vehicle in the area. This will give the assigned Company Officer a heads-up for the
training vehicle, and to allow the Company Officer to plan to use the training vehicle in the most safe
and positive manner.
If the training company plans to move to another battalion for extended operations, the RTO should call
the respective Company Officer and Battalion Chief of the new area and inform them of the vehicular
company’s plans to operate in their area.

RECRUIT COMPANY’S OPERATIONS ON FIELD INCIDENTS
Phoenix Regional Standard Operating Procedures M.P. 206.03 describes in detail the procedure of
Supervising Less Experienced Personnel. This procedure should be understood completely by anyone
involved in the supervision of recruit training companies. Some of the critical issues regarding recruittraining companies are the following:
•

All Command Officers in charge of an incident that has recruit training companies operating on their
incident should be careful of assigning the training crew to any dangerous or critical assignment.
Remember that these training crews are usually two Company Officers and up to 4 recruits. This
may be difficult to closely supervise the recruits while operating in a critical, fast moving
assignment.

•

The recruit training vehicles should avoid adding themselves on to incident many miles away from
their current location. Driving code three many miles through city traffic increases the exposure of
both fire personnel and citizens to unnecessary accidents, and the chances of the training vehicle
getting on the incident scene in time to perform is low. The RTO may choose to add on and
respond Code 2 outside their assigned response area to provide relief for companies working
large/long term fires such as recycle or pallet yard fires.

TRAINING OPERATIONS OF AUTOMATIC AID AND NON-MUTUAL AID FIRE DEPARTMENTS
On occasion, recruit training vehicles and crews from other fire departments will operate within the City
of Phoenix. This may be done in attempts to have the recruits work in high traffic areas and increase
the amount of responses and gain more experience. This is understandable but it must be done
through a structured manner.
Any training crews operating inside the City of Phoenix must belong to the Automatic Aid system. This
ensures that the recruit personnel and their company officers have training that is compatible with that
of Phoenix fire crews. This compatibility will allow for safe and effective fire grounds operations. Any
training crews that are from a system that does not follow Regional Standard Operating Procedures
(Volume 2) as approved by the Regional Operations Consistency Committee (ROCC) or that is not a
member in the Automatic Aid system will not be allowed to operate for training purposes within the City
of Phoenix city limits.
Any non-Phoenix training academy vehicular that conforms to the Automatic Aid guidelines may
operate within the City of Phoenix boundaries. The Chief in charge of Training for the respective
agency should contact the Phoenix Fire Department Training Academy Deputy Chief at least four
weeks prior to the commencement of training. The Deputy Chief of the Training Academy will contact
the Shift Commanders and request permission for the outside agencies to conduct vehiculars for the
desired dates and times. These times and dates will also be placed in the Buckslip and on department
e-mail for all members. In addition, the RTOs of the individual training companies will notify the specific
Battalion Chiefs of the battalions that the training vehicles will be operating in.

The communication of this procedure from Phoenix Fire Department to Automatic Aid departments will
be through the Deputy Chief of Training of the Phoenix Fire Department. The Training Chief is aware
of the other training programs within the Valley, and has established relationships with the other
training chiefs.
For uniformity and recognition, any training vehicles from Automatic Aid fire departments should use
vehicle designations that involve the numbers 96 through 99. The vehicle number may utilize the
numbers of the respective department, followed by 96 – 99. For example, a Glendale training truck
may use Engine 1599. A Tempe training truck may be Engine 2799. Since these numbers are
recognized as training trucks, this would increase the chances of all officers identifying the company as
a training crew and respond accordingly to this procedure and to M. P. 206.03.

OPERATING POWER SAWS
M.P. 206.05

05/93-R

Page 1 of 4

When operating power equipment under emergency conditions, accident potential is high due to
adverse operational conditions. A slight miscalculation or sudden unplanned move can result in a
serious accident. Performance skill coupled with the use of common sense and the strict adherence to
safety procedures can prevent accidents.
PERSONNEL PROTECTION
Full protective clothing shall be worn by those members operating, and by those members in close
proximity to the operation of power saws.
The face shield shall be in position to provide eye protection.
To prevent accidents caused by moving belts, gears, chains, blades, etc., it is imperative that operator
and guide have their protective clothing completely buttoned up.
OPERATING PROCEDURES
Carry the rescue saw with the engine stopped, the blade frontward and muffler away from your body.
Always carry the chain saw with the engine stopped, the guide bar and saw chain to the rear and the
muffler away from your body.
Keep both hands on the control handles when operating the saw. Use a firm grip with thumbs and
fingers encircling the saw handles.
Make sure of your footing before operating the saw.
Whenever possible, a team of two firefighters shall perform cutting operations. The firefighter operating
the saw (operator) will be assisted and/or guided by the second firefighter (guide). The guide may use
the sling in which the saw is carried as a safety harness to guide and assist the operator. (See
Illustrations "A" and "B", "Safety Harness")

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

OPERATING POWER SAWS
M.P. 206.05

The saw shall always be shut down when unattended.
Have a plan of action before putting the saw into operation; your plan should include:
1.
2.
3.

Location and sequence of cuts and openings.
Wind direction. Consider its effect on the saw, exposures and personnel.
Your plan should provide for at least two (2) means of egress if possible.

Whenever possible, an officer should be present to supervise cutting operations and to assure
compliance with safety procedures. The number of personnel should be limited to the minimal number
required to sustain the operation. All other personnel shall be removed to a safe location until the
operation is complete or assistance with the operation is needed.
Always place the safety guard in the proper position to provide protection for the use intended before
operating the saw.
Power saw operations are safest when cutting on horizontal surfaces near ground level or on vertical
surfaces near waist level.
Operating a power saw above chest height is extremely hazardous and should not be attempted as a
normal course of action. This type of operation shall be conducted only under the direct order and/or
under the supervision of an officer. The officer ordering this operation shall weigh heavily the value
gained against the extreme hazard to personnel.
The use of a power saw from ladders is not recommended if there are alternatives.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

OPERATING POWER SAWS
M.P. 206.05

Page 3 of 4

The carrying strap (safety harness) shall be used to carry a saw while climbing a ladder so that both
hands are free to grab the ladder rungs.
Do not operate power saws in suspected flammable/explosive atmospheres.
When operating close to highly combustible materials, use care to prevent ignition from sparks.
Side pressure or twisting of the blade when operating a rescue saw should be avoided. The saw
should never be forced. If too much pressure is applied to the blade, the hazard of blade breakage
(carbide tipped) or blade shattering (aluminum oxide or silicon carbide discs) is increased. A blade
which breaks or shatters during cutting operations may cause serious injury to the operator, or to others
in the area.
The saw cut should be only as deep as necessary. Deep cuts may weaken supporting beams and lead
to collapse. The experienced operator will know when he has reached a beam by the sound and feel of
the saw. The blade guard can be used to control the cutting depth of the blade (rescue saw).
If conditions permit, scrape gravel and debris from the path to be cut, in order to reduce the danger of
injury from flying chips and loose materials. (It also will show the operator which way the rafters are
running.)
When using the rescue saw to open metal buildings, doors, etc., where conditions permit utilize
methods to eliminate the hazards of sharp edges. Consider making your cut in either an X design or a
triangular design with the points bent inward. See illustration (c).
FUELING AND MAINTENANCE PRECAUTIONS:
Observe all safety regulations on the safe handling of fuel. When necessary to refuel, comply with the
following:
1.
2.
3.
4.

The saw should never be refueled while the engine is running.
If fuel is spilled while refueling, wipe off saw before starting.
Do not operate the saw if there is a fuel leak, send it in for servicing.
Do not restart the saw in a small enclosed space after refueling.

Always keep equipment in good, clean, serviceable condition.
Examine the rescue saw cutting wheel for nicks or defects at the beginning of each shift and after each
use.
Clean the wheel (blade) and both wheel washers when installing the wheel. Wheel blotters must be
used between washers and wheel to compensate for irregularities in the wheel.
Care must be taken to assure that the abrasive saw blades do not become contaminated with
petroleum based products. Such contamination may dissolve the resin which is used to bond the
blade, causing the blade to shatter when used. New blades should be stored in plastic bags to insure
cleanliness.

Protective clothing inspections will use the following inspection criteria to evaluate the
condition of protective clothing. Each item will be rated in at least one of the five categories:
1. New
2. Good
3. Fair
4. Exposed
5. Condemned
Cleaning and decontamination of soiled or contaminated ensemble elements must take place
before additional inspection occurs. Cleaning and decontamination are important in
maintaining the integrity of the gear and in reducing exposure to carcinogens.
The following elements should be checked as part of a routine inspection:
•

Soiling
Contamination
Physical damage such as the following:
o Rips, tears and cuts.
o Damaged or missing hardware and closure systems.
o Thermal damage (charring, burn holes, melting, discoloration of any layer).
o Damaged or missing reflective trim.
o Loss of seam integrity and broken or missing stitches.

Protective clothing inspections will be conducted at least one time annually, during Battalion
turnout cleaning. All members are to inspect their turnouts as part of their daily morning
routine and report any issue they may encounter. Each member is responsible for the cleaning,
care and maintenance of each set of protective clothing ensemble, and also responsible for
obtaining repairs when needed by following established Resource Management procedures.
Contaminated Protective Ensembles will be collected on a daily basis from fire stations with
coordination through Resource Management. Resource Management will clean, inspect and
repair, if necessary, any documented needs by the member turning in their ensemble. Resource
will do their best to get the clean ensemble returned to the member before the start of their
next shift.
Resource Management will track and document each set of Protective Ensemble by scanning
every set into their database.
Protective ensembles that need to be replaced will be exchanged at Resource Management at
the earliest opportunity. An electronic Lost, Stolen or Damaged Report(LSD) will need to be

TANK FARM
01/04-R

Page 1 of 7

The Tank Farm, located southwest of the intersection of 51st Avenue and Van Buren Street and
Swissport Fueling at 4200 E. Airlane are major tactical hazards. Due to the degree of the hazards and
the complexity of the occupancies involved, it requires special pre-fire planning considerations that are
included in this procedure.
The Tank Farm serves as the primary distribution point for petroleum products in the Phoenix area.
Most All of these products arrive at the Tank Farm by pipe line or by rail car and are delivered to the
tanks operated by various companies and agencies.
Large quantities of products, primarily flammable and combustible liquids, are stored at this location
and distributed to service stations and other users by tank truck or through additional underground
pipelines.
The incoming pipelines are operated by Kinder Morgan Pipelines, Inc., which also owns and operates
most of the main facility. A number of different companies and agencies store and distribute products
from adjoining facilities. A piping manifold system provides for the distribution of products among the
individual facilities. The central manifold is located on 53rd Avenue in the Kinder Morgan Pipelines yard
in the middle of the Tank Farm area.
Kinder-Morgan and Swissport Pipelines
The pipeline system delivers products to the Tank Farm at a high rate of flow.
(The incoming flow rate may be up to 6300 GPM.) An operator is on duty 24 hours per day at KinderMorgan who can shut down the flow if necessary. In the event of any major spill, including tank
overfilling or a ruptured pipe, orders must be given to shut down the pipeline by the on duty operator.
To shut down the pipeline, Command should direct the Dispatch Center to contact Kinder Morgan
Pipelines to relay this instruction. The telephone numbers are in CAD. It takes several minutes to fully
stop the incoming flow.
A complex system of piping interconnects all of the facilities in the Tank Farm Complex, allowing
products to be delivered or transferred. All of these lines connect to the manifold in the Kinder Morgan
Pipelines yard. The piping manifold can be used for subsurface foam injection into designated storage
tanks.
Swissport operates a 10-inch diameter pipeline that supplies aviation fuel to its tank farm located at
4200 E. Airlane. This pipeline has a flow rate of about 1,200 GPM. The pipeline is routed along 55th
Avenue to the Union Pacific railroad right-of-way, through downtown Phoenix, and terminates at Sky
Harbor Airport. Swissport can stop the flow of the pipeline from its main terminal at 5555 W. Van Buren
or at the Sky Harbor tank farm. Swissport staffs the Van Buren and Sky Harbor Airport tank farms with
an operator 24 hours per day.
Loading Racks
Except for Swissport, there are truck loading racks at each facility in the complex. Product is
transferred at 700 – 1,000 GPM into tank trucks at these racks. There is a potential for large spills
and/or fires if a tank is allowed to overflow or if a line ruptures or becomes disconnected.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

M.P. 206.08

TANK FARM
01/04-R

Page 2 of 7

Many of the loading racks have automatic AFFF deluge sprinkler systems which are activated by heat
or flame detectors with manual activation provided as back-up. In the event of a large spill at the rack,
the deluge system should be manually activated to cover the spill.
The automatic deluge system should be shut down as soon as fire control is achieved. If after the
stored foam supply is exhausted, the system will discharge plain water damaging the foam blanket.
AFFF handlines should be in position when the system is shut down.
Tank Storage
There are three different categories of large storage tanks in use at the Tank Farm complex:
1.

Floating Roof:

2.
3.

Cone Roof:
Cone/Floating Roof:

An open top tank with a floating cover on top of the liquid. (May
also be covered by a geodesic dome).
A fixed top tank.
A tank with both a fixed roof and an internal floating roof

The greatest concern with a tank is the possibility of an overflow spill. Most tanks are equipped with
high level alarm systems to reduce the risk of spills.
An ignited overflow spill will result in a major fire in the dike area around the tank as well as a fire at the
surface level of the tank.
It is always important to control the spill fire before attempting to control the tank surface fire, since a
spill fire would continue to re-ignite vapors coming from the tank. With the spill fire contained, efforts
can be made to control the tank surface fire. The spill area must be secured with a foam blanket for the
duration of the incident.
A floating roof, when in place, limits the amount of surface available to support a fire. If the floating roof
is lost, due to an explosion or sinking, the fire can be expected to intensify rapidly.
Floating roof tanks may experience "rim seal" fires. These fires involve the seal area between the
floating roof and the inside wall of the storage tank. The seals are constructed from synthetic rubber or
plastic. The seal is about 8-12 inches wide, depending on the type of tank. These fires are generally
controllable with small handlines or dry chemical extinguishers. In a cone/floating roof tank, the fire
may be contained in the space between the floating roof and the fixed roof, out of the reach of hose
streams.
When applying foam, care must be taken to avoid sinking or tilting the "floater." NEVER apply plain
water onto a floating roof--it will probably cause the roof to sink.
Entry onto the roof of a floating roof tank can only occur after assessing the risk to our personnel and
determining if the roof is constructed using an “inherently buoyant design.” Floating roofs that are
inherently buoyant are constructed of steel with multiple bulkheads that form liquid tight compartments.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

M.P. 206.08

TANK FARM
01/04-R

Page 3 of 7

The position of the floating roof in relation to the top of the tank shell should also be considered. A
floating roof that is more than 5 feet below the top of the tank shell constitutes a confined space. If entry
onto the roof is being considered as part of the incident strategy, the procedures for confined space
operations outlined in M.P. 204.8 should be applied.
Subsurface foam injection, topside fixed foam chambers, and hydro-foam monitor nozzles are the
preferred method to control a full surface fire. When an entire tank top surface area is involved,
handline streams will not be able to penetrate the thermal column to reach the burning liquid surface.
Large volume AFFF master streams are the only alternative to subsurface injection or fixed systems.
Operations Center - Station 34
In the event of a working incident inside the Tank Farm complex, an Operations Center will need to be
established and announced. The Shell Oil USA Terminal Office on Van Buren Street would serve as a
suitable Operations Center. Representatives of all companies operating within the complex will
assemble at this location to be available if any action involving their facilities is necessary and to
provide information or advice. The responsible party for the facility involved in the incident will report to
the Forward Command Post.
Command will assign a Command Officer and at least one company to the Operations Center. The
Operations Center will provide support as directed by Command. Complete sets of site plans, and
photographs are maintained at Station 34.
All public contact, including P.I.O., and liaison functions will be conducted at the Operations Center,
unless specifically needed at the Command Post. The Command Post will be located in the most
appropriate position to direct tactical operations.
The first unit arriving at the scene of an incident at the Tank Farm shall provide the following
information in the initial report:
•
•
•

Specific location - name of shipper involved
Type of incident - leak, spill, fire or no fire
Extent of spill, leak or fire

The first unit arriving at the scene of an incident at the Tank Farm shall provide the following
information in the initial report:
•
•

Operation of any automatic fire protection, liquid level control or pipeline product delivery
systems
Tank number(s) and location(s)

Command will direct Alarm to notify the 24-hour duty Operator at Kinder Morgan Pipelines of any
working incident. If a major leak or spill is involved, the direction must be given to shut down the
incoming pipeline flow.

Dispatch will also notify the responsible party for the involved property to respond. The Tank Farm has
a call up system to notify all key personnel to respond to the designated Operations Center.
Initial actions should be directed toward the tactical priorities listed below.
Action should proceed cautiously
High level of safety
Avoid committing personnel to dangerous situations

•
•
•

TACTICAL PRIORITIES
Major incidents at the Tank Farm complex will involve either a leak or a spill of a petroleum product.
The situation may or may not involve a fire.
The tactical priorities are:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.

Ensure that company and contract employees are not within a hazardous atmosphere or
have the potential to be exposed.
Cover the spill with a foam blanket to control fire and/or prevent ignition.
Control potential sources of ignition.
Have a HAZ MAT unit monitor the foam blanket to determine its effectiveness.
Contain the spill or run-off.
Identify and control the source of the spill or leak.
Maintain foam blanket until product can be picked up.
Keep all personnel and vehicles out of the spill area.
Maintain an adequate volume of foam solution on scene for the duration of the incident.

NOTE: A large spill can create an extremely large vapor problem and may flash back from ignition
sources at significant distances. While covering the spill to suppress vapors, the direction and
extent of vapor travel must be determined.
Foam Application
When attempting to control a large flammable liquid fire, the strategy should be to wait until enough
foam concentrate to control the fire is on the scene before beginning the attack. If the attack runs out
of foam before the fire is controlled, all of the foam will have been wasted. The minimum foam solution
supply and the total amount of foam water solution required for each storage tank has been calculated
and is available in the Storage Tank Tactical Guidelines contained on Engine and Ladder companies
assigned to Stations 34, 44, 24, 21, 4, and BC3.
NOTE: Foam 34 carries approximately 400 gallons of Class A Foam and 200 gallons of Class B Foam.
Foam Tanker 34 carries approximately 1,000 gallons of 3% AFFF-6% ATC concentrate. Foam
44 carries approximately 400 gallons of Class A Foam and 200 gallons of Class B Foam. If a
fire involves an ethanol tank or other polar solvent, the foam proportioner must be set at 6%.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

M.P. 206.08

TANK FARM
01/04-R

Page 5 of 7

Fires which are controllable with the foam supply on hand should be attacked without delay. This
applies to most spill fires and tank vehicle incidents. If the fire is too large to be controlled by the initial
attack capability, Command should consider a holding action to protect exposures and prevent spread
until additional foam supplies can be assembled and prepared for use.
Subsurface Injection: A system of connections is available to pump foam directly into the main piping
manifold at the Tank Farm. The connections are located in the Kinder Morgan Pipelines property near
the center of the complex. By opening valves and directing the flow, it is possible to direct this flow to
designated tank in the complex and accomplish subsurface injection. This can be performed only with
Foam 34. The details of the required connections and pre- calculated flow rates for each tank are
carried on Foam 34.
Before beginning subsurface injection, it may be necessary to transfer product out of the involved tank
to make room for product in the lines that will be pushed ahead of the foam. Company representatives
MUST be contacted for instructions to transfer any product.
If subsurface foam application is being contemplated the following items should be considered:







Subsurface foam injection cannot be used on ethanol or other polar solvents. The polar
solvents will absorb the water in the foam.
The volume of liquid in the pipeline must be displaced by the foam water solution. Pipeline
volumes can vary from 8,000-25,000 gallons depending on their diameter and distance from
the subsurface injection manifold.
The inlet valve of the storage tank must be open.
If the velocity of the foam water solution exceeds 10 feet/second in the pipeline, the water will
separate from the foam, making it useless.
Depending on the length of the line and the tank height, it may take 30-60 minutes of time
from the time that foam water solution is pumped into the injection manifold until it reaches the
burning surface of the tank.

Fixed Systems: Fixed piping is provided on certain tanks to provide direct delivery of AFFF, from
Foam 34 into the tank. These systems will deliver foam onto the product via topside application at the
tank. A Siamese connection is provided to allow the foam lines to be connected.
NOTE: FIXED FOAM SYSTEMS FOR SUBSURFACE SHALL NOT BE USED PRIOR TO
CONSULTATION WITH THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY.
The use of these systems may require complicated operations to manipulate valves, drain lines or
remove product. These operations require liaison and cooperation with the responsible parties.
Hose Streams: Foam (AFFF) may be applied through 1 1/2 inch handlines from all engine companies.
Master stream capabilities are provided by F34 and FT34 as well as airport crash units. Foam 34 has
the capability to supply hand- lines and/or master streams, including elevated streams on ladder trucks.

When using hose streams, caution must be taken to use a large enough line to penetrate the heat of
the fire from a safe distance.
Foam Supply
If the foam supply on hand at the incident scene is not adequate for the incident, Command should
direct Dispatch to notify Resource Management to begin to assemble a larger supply. This shall be
obtained from:
Truck and Trailer at Station 34 stores 4200 gallons
Fire Department Warehouse
Mutual Aid Fire Departments
Emergency Purchase from vendors
Because of the large foam demands required for ground spill fires, Command should consider
assigning at least one company to assist Foam 44 and creating a Foam Sector. The Foam sector is
responsible for ensuring that a sufficient volume of foam is available to control the fire and to assist in
maintaining a constant supply during foam water solution application. The Foam sector is also
responsible for ensuring that enough foam remains on-hand for continuous application if, after
extinguishment, fire firefighters must enter into the spill area. At least 50% of the amount of foam
required for extinguishment should be maintained available, especially if tank overhaul is required.
Water Supply
The Storage Tank Tactical Guidelines contain water supply data for the tank farm at 51st Avenue/Van
Buren. Analysis of the data reveals that the hydrants within the complex may not provide enough water
for both tank fire suppression and exposure protection. The public water mains on Van Buren and 51st
Avenue have a greater available fire flow. Companies should consider using the public water mains for
supplying water for foam-water application and using the hydrants inside the tank farm complex for
exposure protection. The use of the water mains on Van Buren or 51st Avenue for foam water
application should provide sufficient fire flow for roof collapse or ground fires.
Exposure Protection
When exposure protection is required, large volume water streams should be used for reach and
cooling capacity. Water application must be managed to avoid breaking-up foam blankets or
increasing the problems of fuel spills.
Steam production should be used as a guide to protecting exposures: If steam is created when water
strikes the surface of the tank, the need for protection is indicated. Tanks generally require little
protection on vertical surfaces below the liquid level.
Some of the tank farm facilities have fixed monitor nozzles that can be used to apply cooling water onto
tanks that require exposure protection. These facilities are identified in the Storage Tank Tactical
Guidelines book.

Valve Protection
Product control valves on the storage tanks are beneficial because they can be used to route liquid
from a fire-involved tank to an empty or partially full tank. Failing to protect these valves in the event of
a ground spill fire may prevent tank farm personnel from routing liquid from fire exposed or damaged
tanks. In the event of a ground spill fire that does not submerge the valve in liquid, a fire stream should
be applied to each valve that may be subjected to heat damage. The use of protective streams will
protect the operating components of the valves so that they are not damaged.
Utility Control
If disconnecting the electric power is considered as part of the incident tactics, confirm with the tank
farm personnel the implications of this act. Disconnecting power can shut down transfer pumps used to
remove spilled products at loading racks, cause motor operated valves on storage tanks to close which
prevents subsurface foam injection, and disable controls for all the storage tanks.
Traffic Control
One of the more likely events at the tank farms is a spill resulting from an accidentally overfilled tank.
Given the volatility of the fuels, a large area may be covered with vapors that can be within their
flammable range. Given the location of both tank farms, traffic control should be established early in the
incident to limit the potential for vehicles becoming ignition sources.
For the tank farm at 51st Avenue and Van Buren Street, the minimum boundary for traffic control should
be 59th Avenue to the West, 51st Avenue to the East, the Union Pacific railroad crossing to the South,
and Van Buren to the North. Command should recognize that all of the trucking companies that
transport fuel have access cards that control access gates along 53rd and 57th Avenues. These vehicles
can access the tank farm area unless the major intersections and roadways surrounding the tank farm
complex are blocked.
For the Swissport facility at 4200 E. Airlane, the minimum boundary for traffic control should be 40th
Street at Airlane to the West and Highway 153 between Washington Street and University Drive to the
East. The Union Pacific railroad to the North may need to be shutdown, as well as the parts of the Sky
Harbor access roads and runways to the South.

The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines for the dispatch, response, deployment and
communications model of Phoenix Fire Department resources and members assisting the Phoenix
Police Department with the disposal of explosive materials and/or devices.
In order to provide for the highest level of customer service and to ensure for the safety of officers on
scene of an EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal) operation, the Phoenix Police Department may
request assistance of the fire department for standby medical assistance during special incidents
requiring the deployment of the PPD Bomb Squad. These incidents may include “suspicious packages
or letters, bomb threats etc. This procedure does not necessarily apply to incidents where injuries have
already occurred. When emergency medical stand by is requested by a Phoenix PD Bomb Squad
supervisor through Phoenix Fire Alarm, the on duty Car 958 Captain (Terrorism Liaison Officer) and the
designated PD TLO should immediately be contacted via telephone or pager to contact the Phoenix
Fire Alarm Room. During the majority of EOD operations, the C958 Captain will have already been
briefed on the operation prior to Alarm Room personnel being contacted. However, no matter how the
request for fire department stand by is obtained, it is CRITICAL that information be shared between
Phoenix PD, C958 and the on duty Deployment Battalion Chief, in order to maintain situational
awareness and to provide adequate resources. There may also be instances when other local, county
and State law enforcement agencies will request Phoenix Fire resources to stand by for EOD
operations within the City of Phoenix. When these requests are received, the same approach will be
followed. The fire department will be requested only after a device and/or materials are discovered and
sufficient information/intelligence is gathered by C958 and coordinated through the on duty Deployment
Battalion Chief. NOTE: anytime Phoenix Fire resources are dispatched, the appropriate Battalion Chief
must be contacted and provided situational awareness.
Communications
Due to the critical need for stealth in certain police operations and easy public access to public safety
radio communications, all fire department communications on Police EOD incidents will be conducted
primarily through C958 on an encrypted radio channel. All pertinent information regarding staging
locations, target address, and safety issues will then be relayed to the Company Officer or Command
Officer that will be on scene as stand by. This communication can be made prior to the deployment and
staging of resources over direct telephone line, MCT and/or face-to-face whenever possible. Units shall
avoid any radio traffic in regards to the nature of the incident, address, etc. The Alarm Room TRO
and/or Supervisor will also be made aware of this information for accountability and tracking purposes.
The Alarm Room shall also make all appropriate notifications. Whenever possible, the C958 Captain
and the PD TLO will attend the Bomb Squad briefing where the majority of the information will be
shared. If time does not permit for a formal briefing to be conducted, C958 will make contact with the on
scene Phoenix PD Supervisor to obtain all necessary information pertaining to the operation. Due to the
fact that the C958 Captain is privy to law enforcement sensitive information, only information that is
CRITICAL to the safety and welfare of fire department personnel on scene should be shared.
Once the “target address” is obtained by C958, he/she will determine a safe and secure staging
location for fire resources. C958 will then inform the Alarm Room of the “target address” and request a
premise alert for a minimum of one/quarter (1/4) of a mile for the address. This zone will allow for PD
evacuation zones and routes, encompasses adjoining neighborhoods, large occupancies (apartment
complexes, shopping malls, commercial buildings etc.) and provides a buffer zone for secondary
devices. In this instance, it is crucial that the closest Battalion Chief and Shift Commander are notified
immediately by the Alarm Room. The premise alert will ensure that no other outside fire resources are
dispatched into the location.

In the event of an incident being dispatched in proximity to EOD Operations, the Alarm Room will
contact C958 to determine if the area is safe for fire department units to continue response. If
conditions dictate a response, the closest Battalion Chief should be dispatched to manage the
deployment of resources and to interact with PD to provide field force protection. If the on scene
Command Officer deems it necessary, upgrading to a Tiered Response should be considered with the
Shift Commanders making final determination. The staging location shall be determined by C958 after
attending an initial briefing with the Phoenix PD Bomb Squad.
Deployment
The nearest ALS fire company and rescue company will be dispatched to police EOD operations
anywhere in the city. Response will be CODE 2 unless Code 3 is requested by C958 via the Alarm
Room due to extended response times or critical events that may have unfolded at the EOD operation.
The Deployment Battalion Chief and/or supervisor will notify the on duty Shift Commanders and apprise
him/her of any situation that changes in complexity or severity.
The C958 Captain will act as the initial Incident Commander on scene and will establish a unified
command with the appropriate police department supervisor. CRITICAL NOTE: C958 will act as the
command and Control component on scene and will provide strategic direction for all fire department
resources staged and/or deployed on scene. The main role of the C958 Captain is that of Liaison
between Phoenix PD and Phoenix Fire resources. In the event that the operation changes in size,
complexity and/or severity, C958 shall request appropriate resources and a Command Officer should
be requested to assume the Command and Control piece for fire resources. For long-term, low-key
situations, C958 has the option to stage fire resources in quarters until the PPD Bomb Squad is
prepared to engage in high risk activities. C958 shall keep the Deployment Battalion Chief and/or
supervisor apprised of site operations to ensure adequate safety, support and situational awareness.
For situations of serious nature or complexity, the on scene Command Officer will assume Fire
Command and remain in constant communications via C958, with Police Command. All efforts should
be made to establish a single Unified Command location to enhance safety and operations. Should an
unforeseen accident (critically injured police officer/civilian) occur during the removal/disposal of the
explosive device or material, C958 shall request appropriate resources via the Alarm Room. If a
Command Officer is not on scene, the closest Battalion Chief shall be dispatched to coordinate fire
department resources. The Deployment Battalion Chief or his/her designee shall make proper
notifications, including the on duty Shift Commanders. Level 2 staging shall be considered and strictly
adhered to until the area is determined “secure” to enter by Fire Command and under the advisement
of the Bomb Squad Supervisor. When feasible, C958 shall also request the response of additional
TLO’s to assist with on scene Intelligence and Operational activities.
All members on scene of an EOD operation and/or detonation shall adhere to guidelines set
forth in the PFD Risk Management Plan. It is crucial that all members maintain situational
awareness and be cognizant of the possible presence of secondary explosive devices.
At no time should C958 or any other fire department personnel operate in an active “law
enforcement inner perimeter”. At NO time will fire department equipment or personnel become
directly involved with a search, handling or removal of an explosive device or material.

Based on the determination of the PPD Bomb Squad, the device or material may be disarmed on scene
of the incident or may be transported to an offsite disposal area. If an offsite disposal location is
chosen, C958 and the on scene Command Officer shall evaluate the support functions of the disposal
such as (Evacuation, Rehab, Fire/EMS support, Haz Mat etc.)
If the medical standby is to be of a longer than 2 hours, a rotation of companies should be considered.
C958 will arrange a relief schedule in cooperation with Dispatch & Deployment.
Special Considerations
Occasionally the PPD Bomb Squad may be called out to assist with a suspicious package that was
delivered via the United States Postal Service (USPS). If the package or letter is confirmed NOT to be
an explosive device by the Bomb Squad, C958 shall coordinate efforts with on scene Hazardous
Materials units, C957 and the Command Officer to assure that proper radiological and nuclear testing
have been performed on the package. C958 shall also ensure that the appropriate "Field Safe Survey"
is completed. C958 shall ensure that the Public Health Coordinator for the PFD Homeland Defense
Bureau in notified as early as possible. The Public Health Coordinator is a critical liaison to the Arizona
State Laboratory and the Maricopa County Department of Public Health. This is of great importance
due to the fact that once the substance is through the "Field Safe Survey", packaged and delivered to
the Arizona State Laboratory; the incident becomes an issue of Public Health (notification, treatment,
follow up, etc). State and County public health entities will work in cooperation of the law enforcement
investigation. C958 and the Homeland Defense Public Health Coordinator will then assist the
responsible Law enforcement agency and the USPS Inspector with maintaining the chain of custody
until the package is delivered to the State of Arizona Laboratory for final testing.
NOTE: Occasionally, some County, State and Federal law enforcement agencies may request
Phoenix Fire resources to provide medical stand by, as their own special duty hazardous
materials squads make entry or perform field tests on suspicious packages. Once a request is
received for units through the Phoenix Fire Alarm Room, C958 should be immediately notified
and dispatched prior to any resources being dedicated. C958 can then interface with the
respective law enforcement agency and determine the proper course of action for the resources
being requested. Any information gathered by C958 from the agency can then be shared with
the Deployment Battalion Chief and Shift Commanders.

This procedure describes the response, deployment and communications model of fire department
companies to a request for assistance from the Phoenix Police Department's Special Assignment Unit
(SAU).
In order to provide for the highest level of customer service and to ensure for the safety of officers on
scene of an SAU operation, the Phoenix Police Department may request assistance of the fire
department for standby medical assistance during special incidents requiring the deployment of the
Police Special Assignment Unit (SAU). These incidents may include barricade and hostage situations,
serving of warrants, “drop houses” etc. This procedure does not necessarily apply to incidents where
injuries have already occurred. When emergency medical stand by is requested by a Phoenix PD SAU
supervisor through Phoenix Fire Alarm, the on duty Car 958 Captain (Terrorism Liaison Officer) and the
designated PD TLO should immediately be contacted via telephone or pager to contact the Phoenix
Fire Alarm Room. During the majority of SAU operations, the C958 Captain will have already been
briefed on the operation prior to Alarm Room personnel being contacted. However, no matter how the
request for fire department stand by is obtained, it is CRITICAL that information be shared between
Phoenix PD, C958 and the on duty Deployment Battalion Chief, in order to maintain situational

Communications
Due to the critical need for stealth in certain police operations and easy public access to public safety
radio communications, all fire department communications on Police SAU incidents will be conducted
primarily through C958 on an encrypted radio channel. All pertinent information regarding staging
locations, target address, and safety issues will then be relayed to the Company Officer or Command
Officer that will be on scene as stand by. If the Company Officer’s BC has not been dispatched, he/she
must be notified and briefed on all pertinent information. This communication can be made prior to the
deployment and staging of resources over direct telephone line, MCT and/or face-to-face whenever

The nearest ALS fire company and rescue company will be dispatched to police SAU operations
anywhere in the city. Response will be CODE 2 unless Code 3 is requested by C958 via the Alarm
Room due to extended response times or critical events that may have unfolded at the SAU operation.
The Deployment Battalion Chief and/or supervisor will notify the on duty Shift Commanders and the
appropriate BC to apprise them of any situation that changes in complexity or severity.
The C958 Captain will act as the initial Incident Commander on scene and will establish a unified
command with the appropriate police department supervisor. CRITICAL NOTE: C958 will act as the

nature or complexity, the on scene Command Officer will assume Fire Command and remain in
constant communications via C958, with Police Command. All efforts should be made to establish a
single Unified Command location to enhance safety and operations.
At no time should C958 or any other fire department personnel operate within an active “law
enforcement inner perimeter”. Inner perimeter activities are extremely dynamic and fast moving
with the potential to escalate quickly. An inner perimeter is defined as a forward and isolated
zone where law enforcement officers are in tactical positions with protective gear and weapons
engaged and their primary purpose is mitigating a hostile and/or violent incident or suspect.
On-Site Operations
Responding companies will stage in a safe location from the scene, outside the Police control
perimeter, and out of the line of any possible gun fire. Once the “target address” is obtained by C958,
he/she will determine a safe and secure staging location for fire resources. C958 will then inform the
Alarm Room of the “target address” and request a premise alert for a minimum of one/quarter (1/4) of a
mile for the address. This zone will allow for PD evacuation zones and routes, encompasses adjoining
neighborhoods, large occupancies (apartment complexes, shopping malls, commercial buildings etc.)
and provides a buffer zone for active shooter scenarios. In this instance, it is crucial that the closest
Battalion Chief and Shift Commander be notified immediately via the Alarm Room. The premise alert
will ensure that no other outside fire resources are dispatched into the location. In the event of an
incident being dispatched in proximity to SAU operations, the Alarm Room will contact C958 to
determine if the area is safe for fire department units to continue response. If conditions dictate a
response, the closest Battalion Chief should be dispatched to manage the deployment of resources and
to interact with PD to provide field force protection. If the on scene Command Officer deems it

If the medical standby is longer than 2 hours, a rotation of companies should be considered. C958 will
arrange a relief schedule in cooperation with Dispatch & Deployment.
Additional Resources
The Rehab Unit may be dispatched to the Fire staging location, Code 2 if requested by C958 or the
Command Officer on the scene. Personnel assigned to the Rehab Unit will contact C958 or the IC on
scene and work under their direction. The Rehab unit will remain on-site unless needed for a more
significant incident elsewhere. Phoenix PD also utilizes the services of Phoenix Fire CR Vans
occasionally. CR Van personnel are utilized for assisting with families, customers or “crime victims” that
may be impacted by the SAU operations. In the event that a CR Van is requested to respond to the
scene by PD, C958 will be their point of contact to ensure the scene is secure. At no time should CR
Van personnel be dispatched to an SAU operation without C958 knowledge and/or advisement.
Safety
Fire department deployment to SAU operations is for standby medical assistance only should a police
officer or civilian be injured. Fire personnel WILL NOT become directly involved in law
enforcement assault operations. Fire personnel WILL NOT enter an area that is not secure
and/or safe to enter. If the area is not safe, the police department may have to deliver the patients to
Fire personnel at the perimeter. The safety of the scene should continually be assessed by C958 and
any Company/Command Officer that is on scene.
Occasionally, SAU personnel may make special requests for equipment that fire department units have
access to (ladders, TIC cameras, forcible entry tools etc). These requests should be considered on a
case by case basis and units will cooperate if the request is appropriate, after consulting with C958 and
the Battalion Chief.
Should an unexpected event occur (i.e., sudden unexpected gunfire injuring a person), C958 or
Command Officer will request the appropriate additional resource (i.e., additional rescue, 2-1 medical,
etc.). All efforts should be made to ensure that units respond and stage to a safe staging location away
from SAU operations, prior to entering the scene. When feasible, C958 shall also request the response
of additional TLO’s to assist with on scene Intelligence and Operational activities.
Should a planned assault be scheduled by SAU, the appropriate stand by resources should be
requested prior to the assault action. Coordination of these resources should be handled by C958 in
cooperation with the Deployment Battalion Chief.

Out of Jurisdiction SAU Operations
Due to the fact that Phoenix PD officers have state-wide jurisdiction, Phoenix PD SAU occasionally will
engage in operations (search warrants) outside the City of Phoenix. In the event this occurs, the SAU
Supervisor may request that fire department resources be coordinated with that respective jurisdiction,
utilizing C958 as the Liaison. C958 will make efforts to contact the agency’s TLO (if applicable) and
coordinate the appropriate medical response. C958 has the option to respond with the PD TLO out of
the City to assist with coordinating the fire resources for Phoenix PD SAU. Once an SAU operation is
planned in another jurisdiction and fire resources will be utilized for medical stand by, C958 shall
communicate this to the Deployment Battalion Chief. The respective Command Officer (Operations)
and TLO for that agency should also be contacted and made aware of the operation.
Some SAU operations may also occur outside the reaches of the Valley-Wide Automatic Aid Region,
which is the responsibility of the Phoenix Fire Alarm Room. If SAU operations are planned in these
locales, C958 will advise the SAU supervisor that the standard medical stand by that is normally
available, may not be available in these distant jurisdictions. C958 will still make efforts to contact local
fire/EMS providers and act as a Liaison between SAU and these local agencies. C958 may also
consider placing a medical helicopter (Ranger 41, Native Air etc.) on stand by if feasible. Helicopter
standby will be coordinated between the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) and the Phoenix Fire
Alarm Room. In addition, C958 and the AHJ shall work together to establish an appropriate Landing
Zone.
Due to limitations in communications, interoperability and consistency in out of region SOP’s regarding
medical helicopter operations, the responsibility should be upon that of the home fire/EMS agency to
coordinate Command/LZ responsibilities. C958 will continue to function as the Liaison between the
agency and Phoenix PD SAU and assist with direction as conditions dictate. Except in extreme
circumstances (critically injured police officer) and in a designated “secure” treatment sector, C958
should refrain from initiating treatment. Initial medical care should be initiated by the home fire/EMS
agency and when available, Phoenix PD EMT’s assigned to SAU entry teams.
CRITICAL NOTE: It is NOT the standard practice to dispatch and deploy Phoenix Fire
Department ALS/BLS units and rescues outside the Automatic Aid system. Requests for PFD
units to respond outside the Automatic Aid system will be made through the Phoenix Fire
Deployment Battalion Chief along with coordination from the on duty Shift Commanders.
Phoenix PD SAU supervisors should be made aware of limitations when operating under these
conditions and locations.

YOUTH FIRESETTERS INTERVENTION PROGRAM
M.P. 206.10

Page 1 of 4

DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM
The Phoenix Fire Department’s Youth Firesetter Intervention Program has taken a positive approach in
its efforts to stop youth firesetting. A goal to stop firesetting in our community by youths has been
established. Assistance and support to the community is being offered. This is accomplished through
investigation, identification, assessment, evaluation, education, and appropriate referral to mental
health services described in the following M. P.
ENTRY INTO PROGRAM
Field Captain
If a youth firesetter is identified at the fire scene, the Field Captain can forward an electronic referral via
the fire intranet or complete a Youth Assistance Referral form 91-57D which should be carried on each
apparatus at all times. This form is then forwarded to the Youth Firesetter Intervention Program in
Urban Services. A follow-up letter will be returned to the referring person via email.
If evidence at the fire scene (witnesses, type of fire, etc.) indicates a youth started the fire, the Captain
must report this youth firesetter involvement on the Incident Encounter Form.
Station walk-ins
If a family comes to a fire station with their children who have been involved with firesetting, contact the
Youth Firesetter Intervention Program; office hours are from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through
Friday, phone 602-262-7757. If the situation appears to be a crisis, contact the Alarm Room for an
appropriate referral.
NOTE: TOURS OF THE FIRE STATION ARE INAPPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME. This tends to be
viewed by children as a reward for negative behavior of setting fires.
When to Call an Investigator
Fire Captains should call an investigator any time there is evidence of arson. If there are witnesses
and/or suspects at the scene with information that could identify the youth firesetter.
Also, request an investigator if the fire is of unknown origin or the cause cannot be determined. If the
fire was set intentionally and the child is 8 to 18 years old an investigator needs to be notified. A
referral to the Juvenile Court Center will be made if the youth is charged with a misdemeanor or felony.
The court will mandate the youth to the diversion program for first time offenses.This program consists
of two components: fire safety education and consequences of firesetting, along with seven sessions of
counseling. Youth charged with felony arson or repeat offenders will be referred to the Maricopa
County Attorney’s Office for prosecution.
When the investigator determines the fire was accidental due to curiosity, experimentation or
negligence and was not intentionally set, the youth is typically not referred to the Juvenile Court Center.
The investigator will make a referral to the Youth Firesetter Intervention Program and the family will
attend the Youth Fire Safety Class on a voluntary basis.

Family Referral
When a family is referred to the Youth Firesetter Intervention Program, a phone interview is conducted
to determine the severity of the problem. If the child is curious or experimenting with fire, a referral is
made to the Youth Fire Safety Class. In addition, if the problem seems to be a crisis situation, a
referral is made to a mental health professional. The family is sent an invitation to the Fire Safety Class
along with some information on fire safety.
INTERVENTION STRATEGIES
Youth Fire Safety Class
The class is held one Saturday or one Thursday night a month at a Phoenix Fire Department facility. A
Youth Firesetter Intervention Program team member instructs the class. The morning classes are held
from 9:00 a.m. to noon for children ages 3 through 7. The preschool class is for children 3, 4, and 5.
The 6 and 7-year-olds attend a separate class. Both morning classes teach fire safety behaviors.
The afternoon class is held from 1:00 to 4:00 p.m. for youth ages 8 through 12. This class addresses
the consequences of firesetting as well as responsibility issues incurred with firesetting. All classes are
available at no cost to the family and are voluntary. Parental attendance is strongly recommended.
The Thursday evening class is held from 6 to 9 p.m. for youths 8 through 17 years of age. The class
addresses the consequences of firesetting as well as the responsibilities incurred with firesetting. In
this class the students discuss Arizona Arson and Fireworks Laws, and the definitions for felony and
misdemeanor.
Counseling
If the family is experiencing a severe problem with firesetting, the caseworker will refer them to a mental
health professional. The counseling component consists of at least seven sessions. The provider will
work with the client to investigate existing insurance. If no mental health insurance is available through
the client, budgeted funds from the Phoenix Fire Department will be used. These visits are voluntary.
Diversion Program
When an investigator makes a referral to the Juvenile Court Center and the youth is charged with a
misdemeanor, he/she may be eligible for the diversion program for first time offenders. This program
consists of a three-hour class on the third Thursday of each month. A Youth Firesetter Intervention
Program team member teaches the class. The primary focus of the class is on consequences of
firesetting; i.e., life and property, misdemeanors, felonies and the effects on the fire service.
The youth is also referred to a mental health professional for at least seven sessions of counseling
mandated by the Juvenile Court Center. Both components must be completed for credit. Youths
charged with felony arson crimes and/or repeat offenders are not eligible for the diversion program and
will be referred to the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office for prosecution.

COMMUNITY SUPPORT
Community Advisory Panel
This group meets on a quarterly basis to discuss the problems of youth firesetting throughout the
community. Their main objective is to reduce firesetting and make other agencies aware of the
program. This group involves Child Protective Services, police, Juvenile Court Center, schools, mental
health providers, burn center representatives, insurance companies, etc.
Urban Survival
The Urban Survival curriculum is utilized in many schools throughout Phoenix. Often, the Community
Education Specialists (Fire Pals), along with school staff, have contact with firesetter’s. The curriculum
includes an explanation of firesetters and information for further assistance regarding entry into the

Page 1 of 2

POLICY
The Fire Department does not exterminate bees. The Fire Department will deploy units to rescue
and/or treat victims of an Africanized Honey Bee (AHB) attack. The purpose of this procedure is to
outline a process by which fire companies will approach and manage an AHB attack.
DISPATCH
When the Dispatch Center receives a call for AHB attack, two fire department units (one being an
ALS engine company and one ladder company) and a Battalion Chief should be dispatched. They
shall proceed Code III to the scene and arrive being careful not to commit themselves in the path
of the source of bees, approximately 150 feet from the colony.
ON-SCENE
Upon arrival at an AHB incident site, a rapid evaluation should be made by the first arriving
Company Officer and the following activities implemented:
• Determine if there are any victims which will require rescue and/or medical treatment.
• Designate a Level II staging area for subsequent arriving fire department units and/or other
agencies which are also responding.
Once on the scene, three crew members shall don full structural firefighting personnel protective
equipment (PPE) including SCBA. Ankles and waist should be taped tight to prevent bees from
crawling up the chest or legs. If firefighters have Bee PPE, they may wear this in place of structural
firefighting PPE.
APPROACH
A quick attack 1 ¾ inch hose line shall be pulled by the firefighter at a quick pace towards the
affected patient(s). A fog pattern on the nozzle should be used, sweeping the air surrounding the
firefighters and patient. The patient should be quickly picked up while at the same time sweeping
the surrounding air with the hose line. The hose line should continue to be sprayed to keep the
bees off the firefighters and the patient when retreating to a safe distance approximately 150 feet
from the swarm. At this time, it should be reevaluated if the area retreated to is far enough away
to begin more definitive treatment of the patient. Class A firefighting foam may be used at the
highest concentration possible as it has been found to assist in allowing water to adhere to the
bees.
CLASS B FIREFIGHTING FOAMS CONTAINING PERFLUOROALKYL OR POLYFLUOROALKYL
SUBSTANCES (PFAS) SHOULD NOT BE USED.

Toxic Exposure Investigations Program
M.P. 206.16

01/19

Page 1 of 3

Policy
It is the policy of the Phoenix Regional Fire Department to investigate and document all known
or suspected toxic exposures. The Phoenix Fire Department Health Center will collect all data
and maintain records of all exposures. The designated Certified Industrial Hygienist to the
Phoenix Fire Department will be responsible for the collection of all samples and
communication with the appropriate laboratory on their findings.
Toxic Exposure Forms are located on every station computer on Fire Point, or can be accessed
on personal/mobile devices at http:cityofphoenix.sharepoint.com/sites/fire.
Purpose
The purpose of the investigation and reporting of toxic exposures is to document all known and
unknown substances that a member may have been exposed to on any given incident. In cases
where a member’s health is affected by toxic substances, the documentation and laboratory
findings will be used to support the evidence of possible adverse health effects.
Contents
Incident number, time, date, location, and business/occupancy name: This data is to be filled
out from the corresponding dispatch information. Inaccurate information must be corrected as
soon as possible or notified to the Toxic Exposure Officer.
Incident Type: Select the appropriate category. If any unusual circumstances exist, fill out the
Other/Describe section as accurately as possible.
Chemicals involved in incident: Obtain from on-scene Command, Haz Mat sector, or C957 N/S.
List chemicals from Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), or bill of lading.
Units exposed: Obtain from incident history. List all units.
Lab results: These forms may not be readily available until the laboratory or the Industrial
Hygienist completes all testing and findings are completed. Once the results are received by
the Toxic Exposure Officer, those reports will be filed and stored at the Phoenix Fire
Department Health Center. Electronic Toxic Exposure forms on Share Point will then be
updated to include these results to each member’s report by the Toxic Exposure Officer.

Toxic Exposure Reporting
Phoenix Regional Fire Department members who are exposed to known or suspected toxic
substances during the performance of work duties must contact the Toxic Exposure Officer.
The Toxic Exposure Officer will initiate the toxic exposure investigation.
On all incidents where personnel are exposed, a minimum of the Toxic Exposure Form shall be
completed. In an exposure incident where personnel feel symptomatic, they shall follow the
Toxic Exposure Notification process below.
Toxic Exposure Notification
When personnel are exposed to toxic substances, whether known or suspected, Dispatch and
Deployment, along with their Immediate Supervisor should be contacted immediately so that
the investigation can be initiated at the time of the exposure and at the incident location of the
exposure. Dispatch will then notify the Toxic Exposure Officer.
Due to the type of exposure, and the probability of multiple employees becoming exposed, the
TEO will communicate with Car 957 and Command at the incident.
The Toxic Exposure Officer will be responsible for gathering information as it comes available
to him/her, and shall be included in his/her findings in the report.
Notification of all employees exposed will be made as soon as possible. All exposed employees
shall fill out a Fire Personnel Toxic Exposure Report located on Fire Point.
Symptomatic exposed personnel shall be transported to the Phoenix Fire Department Health
Center or to Banner University Medical Center Phoenix (depending on severity) for evaluation
and treatment. Consider the availability of hyperbaric chamber therapy at Banner University
Medical Center Phoenix for members with known or suspected smoke inhalation.
Notification should be made to Car 959 in instances where members are transported to a
hospital. The Car 959 Officer can serve as liaison between the TEO and hospital staff.

Documentation of Exposure
The Toxic Exposure Officer is responsible for conducting an investigation and completing a
report in conjunction with the Certified Industrial Hygienist designated to the Phoenix Fire
Department. The investigation will also consist of sample collection at the incident performed
by the Certified Industrial Hygienist and may be assisted by the Hazardous Material Team if
proper PPE is required. The Toxic Exposure Officer or designee can special call a hazardous
materials unit to conduct sample collecting if the nature of the incident so dictates it. The
Certified Industrial Hygienist will determine what types of samples to collect and then be
responsible for getting the samples to a lab for analysis. The Certified Industrial Hygienist will
have a sample collection kit that will be given to the hazardous materials team for the
collection of samples. Each sample will be identified with an identification number and
categorized appropriately. Location, time and date of sample collection will also be
documented by the Toxic Exposure Officer or Certified Industrial Hygienist. Once the data is
collected and the sample analysis is received from the lab, the Toxic Exposure Officer will add
the results to each members Toxic Exposure Form and file the results in the archives at The
Phoenix Fire Department Health Center.

TRACKING OF ASYMPTOMATIC BIO- EXPOSURE PATIENTS
M.P. 206.16A

07/03-N

Page 1 of 2

POLICY
It is the policy of the Phoenix Fire Department to provide the best possible care to all patients
encountered. It is anticipated that most events involving biological agents will not generate a
scene to which personnel could respond. This is the case because biological agents are slow
acting and the public health surveillance systems may require days to detect patterns of
causalities. It is also possible in a biological incident that victims at the scene may exhibit no
symptoms.
PURPOSE
The purpose of the bio-exposure information card is to capture information that may be used in
epidemiological tracking. A copy of the bio-exposure information card is contained on page 2
of this procedure. The bio-exposure information card when completed will contain the
following information:
Front of card

Back of card

Date of incident
Victim name, address, phone number(s)
Destination from scene
Symptomatic/EMS evaluation (Y or N)

Date of incident
Probable exposure
Location of exposure
Notification of MCDPH*
Arrival/Departure airline
(If airport incident)

PROCEDURE
If the medical decision is to allow asymptomatic victims to leave the scene or there are
victims that are demanding to leave the scene, a bio-exposure card will be completed prior to
their departure from the scene. In the event that the scene is at Sky Harbor, the cards will be
collected from all passengers who arrive on aircraft where (1) there is evidence of or (2)
credible reason to suspect exposure has taken place. Completed bio-exposure cards will be
forwarded via interoffice mail to EMS/Public Health Programs Manager. Copies of the cards
are to be provided to MCDPH* and Epidemiology Section of the AzDHS**.
RESPONSIBILITIES
Bio-exposure information cards are available for use on all apparatus. Reorder of cards
through information services via the district offices.

PRE-PLANNING FOR EMERGENCIES

M.P. 206.18

10/97-N

Page 1 of 3

PURPOSE
Pre-incident planning can provide valuable information about an occupancy which can improve the
ability of firefighters to respond effectively to a fire or other emergency at that location. Pre-incident
planning addresses vital fire protection concerns, such as: structure layout including access, contents,
construction details, types and locations of built-in fire protection systems. It includes all data which
can have an impact on decisions or actions taken during an emergency. Pre-incident planning should
be a joint venture between emergency services personnel and the occupants/owners of the property.
This procedure identifies the roles and responsibilities for fire companies, fire districts,
Urban Survival for Business, and Dispatch & Deployment in pre-planning for emergencies
including: Occupancy selection, Tactical Premise entry into the Phoenix Fire Department
RMS system, and record keeping.
FIRE COMPANIES
Each quarter, company officers will select a tactically significant occupancy to pre-plan for emergency
incidents in their first due area. What determines a "tactically significant occupancy" may vary
according to an individual company's response area but, may include, industrial facilities such as
woodworking, hazardous materials, general manufacturing or large storage facilities, residential
occupancies such as apartment complexes, condominium complexes, convalescent homes, or senior
care facilities, high-rise buildings, health care facilities such as hospitals, clinics or laboratories, and any
other occupancy the company officer feels is tactically significant.
When the company officer has selected an appropriate site for a pre-plan, he/she should meet the
owner/occupant at the selected site and, together with the owner/occupant, complete the Tactical
Premise Pre-plan Authorization Form. Once a pre-plan has been scheduled, the company officer
should forward a copy of the Tactical Premise Pre-plan Authorization Form to his/her battalion chief.
One copy will be kept by the company officer and placed in the Station Tactical Premise log. A sample
of the Tactical Premise Pre-plan Authorization Form can be found in the Tactical Premise handbook.
The company officer is expected to make every pre-plan a training opportunity. Pre-fire planning
guidelines can be found in the Building familiarization/Tactical Premise handbook. Pre-plan information
should be shared with the other two shifts in the station so they can conduct a walk through in the preplanned occupancy. Each company on each shift should schedule and complete a Tactical
Premise pre-plan on different occupancies.
During the pre-plan, the company will fill out the BUILDING FAMILIARIZATION / TACTICAL PREMISE
worksheet. Companies are encouraged to make drawings or record other information which may be
useful in a response book carried on the apparatus. When the company returns to quarters, the
information on the Building Familiarization/Tactical Premise worksheet is
entered into the Tactical Premise portion of the RMS system in the station computer. NOTE: If the
company is located in a Fire District with a designated Tactical Premise Coordinator, the
completed Building Familiarization/Tactical Premise worksheet is forwarded to the District
Office for entry into the CAD system (see District Responsibilities). Once the information has been
entered, the company officer will make a computer printout of the Tactical Premise information and
forward the printout to his/her battalion chief.

Page 2 of 3

FIRE DISTRICT RESPONSIBILITY
The District Commander may choose to designate a District Tactical Premise Coordinator whose
primary responsibility would be Tactical Premise data entry. This would increase the possibilities of
consistent data entry.
When the battalion chief receives a copy of the Tactical Premise pre-plan authorization form, he/she
will place the form in the District pre-plan log. Battalion chiefs should make every effort to accompany
fire companies when they are conducting a pre-plan.
After the pre-plan information is in the RMS system, the battalion chief will receive a copy of the
Tactical Premise computer printout and then place it with the Tactical Premise pre-plan authorization
form in the District pre-plan log. The date the pre-plan was completed should be added to the Tactical
Premise pre-plan authorization form in the space provided.
When the Tactical Premise pre-plan authorization form is completed, the battalion chief will
make two copies of the completed form and forward them to the engine and ladder company that
completes the 2-1 first due assignment for the pre-planned occupancy so they can access the
information in Tactical Premise.
URBAN SURVIVAL FOR BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY
The fire prevention specialist assigned to each District will review the District pre-plan log at the
beginning of each month. The fire prevention specialist will advise the battalion chief(s) that he/she is
available should any company need technical assistance regarding Fire Code issues in the buildings
scheduled for pre-planning.
Each fire prevention specialist assigned to Urban Survival for Business participates in the SelfInspection Program and is responsible for contacting 25 businesses per week. The fire prevention
specialist will place information received from these contacts into the Tactical Premise portion of RMS
including, Business Name and Address, Responsible Party information, and any other information
which may be useful to responding companies.
Fire prevention specialists routinely respond to service requests in all categories of tactically significant
occupancies, inspect industrial facilities, and respond to fire company requests
for service. Every time a fire prevention specialist makes contact with a business or other
occupancy, the fire prevention specialist will obtain responsible party information from that occupancy
and place that information into Tactical Premise. The fire prevention specialist will occasionally
encounter an occupancy which is tactically significant but which has no information in Tactical Premise.
The fire prevention specialist will bring this information to the attention of the District Commander of the
Fire District which contains the occupancy.
Whenever a fire prevention specialist encounters a situation that changes the Tactical Premise
information for a specific occupancy, the fire prevention specialist will enter the changes into the
Tactical Premise portion of the RMS system. The Tactical Premise entry will receive a new revision
date and a computer printout of the updated information will be made. The fire prevention specialist will
then forward a copy of the updated information to the first due company officer. The fire prevention
specialist will send a second copy of the Tactical Premise printout to the battalion chief who will update
the District Pre-plan log.

DISPATCH AND DEPLOYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
When it becomes obvious that there is a working fire, hazardous materials incident, or other incident
which might require information contained in Tactical Premise, the Dispatch and Deployment Captain
will immediately begin monitoring the tactical radio channel.
While units are responding or as soon as practical, the Dispatch and Deployment Captain will
retrieve tactical and/or responsible party information from the Tactical Premise database using the TP,
TPI, or TPB commands .
Having the Tactical Premise information displayed at the alarm Captains terminal will allow
him/her to provide critical information to command when needed. For example; Phoenix units are
working a structure fire at Troy Biosciences, the first in ladder company has not had time to look at
Tactical Premise information for this structure and Command says “go to the roof and ventilate.”
The Dispatch and Deployment Captain has been listening to the radio traffic and sees that Troy
Biosciences (through the Tactical Premise display on his terminal) has a metal clad roof. The
Dispatch and Deployment Captain relays this information to Command who advises the Ladder
to take a metal saw blade with them. The roof is quickly ventilated and the progress of the fire is
stopped.
Tactical Premise may be accessed using the TP, TPI, TPB, RP, RPI, and RPB commands from any
terminal in Dispatch. If the Dispatch and Deployment Captain is busy with another incident, the
Supervisor or TRO will provide Tactical Premise information as noted above.

PURPOSE
This procedure provides guidelines for managing emergency incidents involving the Valley Metro
Light Rail System (VMR), highlights specific life safety hazards inherent to the system, and also
discusses considerations for shutting down power to the system when necessary. This procedure
also provides light rail system information necessary for safe operation and focuses on the most
likely light rail scenarios crews will encounter. However, these guidelines are not a universal
remedy, and due to the limitless possible scenarios responding personnel could encounter,
responding crews should always evaluate risk and exercise caution when operating near the light
rail system.
LIGHT RAIL TERMS
LRV= light rail vehicle
OCS= overhead catenary system (overhead light rail electrical wires)
TPSS= traction powered substation
ETS= emergency trip switch (located at TPSS)
OCC= operations control center (nerve center for communications and operations of light rail)
Pantograph= large mechanical arm that connects the LRV to the overhead wires
BACKGROUND
The Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs) operate on DC electric current supplied from the substations (TPSS)
by two overhead wires (OCS). LRV’s connect with the light rail system in an electrically powered
public transportation system. The light rail uses a two-track system that typically run parallel to
each other. The LRVs connect with the OCS via a pantograph (large mechanical arm) that can be
raised and lowered. The tracks operate as the negative return (not a significant electrical threat)
for the current. The Operations Control Center (OCC) functions as the nerve center for the light rail
and is able to communicate directly with light rail Operators, Transportation Supervisors, and
maintenance crews. The OCC is responsible for coordinating all light rail related emergency
LIGHT RAIL OPERATIONS
Page 1 of 6

activity. In the event of an emergency, the OCC has the ability remotely de-energize the OCS. The
OCC is located in the VMR Operations and Maintenance Center (605 SS. 48th St, Phoenix). The
estimated train frequency is every 12 minutes during peak operations and every 20 minutes during
off-peak hours. The LRV’s are controlled with an Operator located in the forward cab (each end
has a cab) of the LRV. The Operator must operate the train by utilizing a controller which controls
accelerations and braking. The controller is equipped with a “dead man” switch, which will bring
the LRV to a complete stop if the Operator becomes incapacitated. The system times traffic lights
using a predicative priority signally system that changes the signals much like the pedestrian
button and car sensors do, but the only system that actively takes control of traffic signals is the
Opticom system (when equipped) used by emergency responders. Train operators are required
to stop for all red lights and hazards.

• 2000-6000 AMPs (Taser is .00021 amps 50k volts)
• Wires are tensioned at 5,000 lbs. top wire, and 3000 lbs. bottom wire
• Wires will whip if severed
• The normal height of the light rail overhead contact system wire is 18 feet; however, the
underpass at Washington and the SR143 has a max height of only 14.5 feet. BEWARE of
lights, flags, or anything else sticking up when crossing the line

RESPONSE
Crews responding Code 3 across the tracks shall adhere to our Code 3 driving procedures.
Additionally, any protrusion (extended utility lights, flags, etc.) must be lowered to avoid contact
with OCS. Furthermore, the tracks represent an additional lane of traffic that must be cleared when
driving. Left hand turns across the tracks account for the highest incidents of collisions with LRV’s.

Adds additional lane of traffic
Normal height of OCS is 18 feet
Lowest point is 14.5 feet located at Washington and the SR143 overpass
Have all lights and/or flags lowered

OPERATING IN LIGHT RAIL INTERSECTIONS
LRV’s are approximately 9 feet wide and operate on fixed rail. As such, LRV’s are incapable of
making contact with an object located outside of the LRV’s dynamic envelope. LRV Operators are
trained to operate at walking speed when emergency personnel are near the tracks. LRV’s are
equipped with a Car Wash Mode feature which restricts speed to no greater than 2MPH. The car
wash mode may be activated upon request. If LRV movement could compromise the safety of
firefighters operating on or adjacent to the light rail tracks, the Company Officer should contact
Fire Dispatch and request a notification be made to the OCC to operate LRV’s on the alternate track
(Single Track Operation). The OCC will dispatch a Transportation Supervisor to the scene and
implement an alternate service plan to ensure the safety of Fire personnel. Crews must remain
watchful for LRV’s, and Company Officers should consider assigning a crew member to watch for
LRV’s. In scenarios where both light rail tracks are obstructed (e.g., collision blocking both tracks,
supply lines etc.) Company Officers must contact the Fire Dispatch and request a notification be
made to the OCC advising of such conditions.
RESPONDING TO EMS CALLS ON THE LRV
• LVR Operator will coordinate next stop location with OCC and Alarm Room.
• The alarm room will provide the address and location during dispatch.
• Any open door on an LRV engages the brake and disables the throttle ensuring that the
LRV will not move.
• As long as the LRV is functioning normally and on the track, there is no need to shut down
power. This will allow the AC and lights to continue functioning.
• Maintain awareness of both LRV and vehicle traffic.

RESPONDING TO LRV VERSUS ANOTHER VEHICLE
When an LRV makes contact with a vehicle, the LRV Operator will notify the OCC. The Operator
will then check all LRV’s, and the occupants of the other vehicle for injury. All injury information
will be relayed to the OCC. Due to low operating speeds most LRV collisions will not result in a
derailment. A collision with a large vehicle (e.g., semi-truck, dump truck etc.) may result in a
LIGHT RAIL OPERATIONS
Page 3 of 6

derailment. If this occurs the LRV Operator will lower the pantograph and eliminate the
electrocution risk from the OCS.
In the event of derailment where the pantograph becomes entangled or is unable to be lowered,
the entire LRV becomes energized and poses a significant electrocution risk to both emergency
responders and any passenger who makes ground contact (completes the circuit).
Company Officers should complete the following evaluation upon arrival to any LRV derailment
or LRV vs. large vehicle accident:
ELECTRICAL HAZARD SIZE UP QUESTIONS
• Is the LRV on the tracks?
o If LRV is on tracks, pantograph may stay raised.
o If LRV is derailed, pantograph must be lowered.
• Is the Pantograph raised/tangled?
• Is the OCS intact (no poles or wires down)?
ELECTRICAL HAZARD SIZE UP
Scenario #1: If the LRV is derailed and the pantograph is still in contact with the OCS, responding
crews should not make contact with the LRV and advise the LRV Operator to lower the pantograph.
If the LRV Operator is unable to lower the pantograph, the Company Officer must de-energize the
OCS by employing the use of Option #1 or Option #2.
Scenario #2: If the OCS has been compromised or appears to be severely damaged, or if lines are
down then crews should not approach the LRV or track. The OCS must be de-energized by
employing the use of Option #1 or Option #2.
Option #1: The Company Officer must contact Fire Dispatch and request a notification be
made to the OCC to remotely de-energize the OCS. The OCC will have a visual notification
that the OCS has been de-energized and will dispatch a Transportation Supervisor to
respond to the incident scene with a Hot Stick to provide physical assurance that the OCS
is de-energized.
Option #2: The Company Officer should assign another company (or do it themselves if in
close proximity) to push the emergency trip switch (ETS) at the closest TPSS (requires Knox
key). Pushing the ETS at the TPSS shuts down incoming AC power and outgoing DC power,
and also sends a signal to the adjacent substations and shuts down their outgoing DC
power, effectively isolating the section of line from power. However, there is no visible
confirmation that power has actually been shut down. The Company Officer must contact
Fire Dispatch and request a notification be made to the OCC requesting a Transportation
Supervisor with Hot Stick to confirm that the OCS is de-energized.
LIGHT RAIL OPERATIONS
Page 4 of 6

In both instances Crews should refrain from physically touching the LRV and advise passengers
to wait inside the LRV, until power has been confirmed to be de-energized.
ACCESS AND EXTRICATION
• Easiest access is through the LRV doors. Crew can manually open them by opening the
exterior (emergency door releases). There is one location on each side of the vehicle,
located on the left side when facing the LRV.
o Windows are extremely hard to break
o Cutting through the body of the LRV doesn’t provide adequate access
• The train has been engineered with a bumper and bar 3 inches off the track to reduce the
chance of a person becoming trapped underneath.
• LRV’s are extremely heavy and unstable when lifting and this should be considered a last
resort.
• Valley Metro has a vehicle that can safely lift LVRs, but it has an estimated response time
of 30-60 minutes
TRAFFIC CONTROL
• Protect scene as necessary
• Beware of other LRV’s in opposite direction
• Consider assigning a crewmember as lookout for LRV’s
• Consider PD for traffic control
RESPONDING TO LRV FIRES
LRVs do not have a fire protection system (no sprinklers). Most of the working equipment (A/C,
power supplies, and batteries) are located on the top of the LRV. Crews must ensure the LRV, and
OCS are de- energized prior to attempting extinguishment of any significant LRV fires. Fires in the
bottom undercarriage should only be extinguished after the pantograph has been lowered but
does not necessitate shutting down the OCS.
Evacuate LRV (life safety first) to a safe location away from smoke
• Shut down power as necessary
• Stop other LRV traffic as necessary
• Protect the scene from traffic
RESPONDING TO FIRE AT TPSS
• Treat it like electrical substation/vault
• Do Not Enter or put water on it until absolutely confirmed de-energized by APS or SRP
• Beware of OCS
• Consider pushing the ETS, if it is safe to do so
• Call for hazmat if smoke is coming from within TPSS
• Be aware of the risk of hazardous smoke inhalation
LIGHT RAIL OPERATIONS
Page 5 of 6

MISCELLANEOUS
Natural Gas Incidents
• LRV’s produce significant sparks and represent an ignition source for natural gas leaks
• LRV’s traffic should be halted for any significant gas leak within close proximity
Impact of Smoke Plume on Light Rail System
• Treat the same way we treat other road closures for smoke plumes
o LRV’s have the ability to shut off outside air if necessary, and this should be a
minimum consideration if LRV’s are passing by smoke
IMPACTS TO FIRE OPERATIONS
The light rail system impacts Fire Department operations in several ways. First, the OCS represents
an electrical hazard as do other electrical lines. OSHA requires any apparatus, ladders, or other
equipment to maintain a ten-foot clearance from ungrounded electrical sources such as the OCS.
The tracks present access obstacles and influence apparatus placement. Lastly, the alignment can
impact water supply.
Consider the following:
• OCS electrical hazards
o Must stay 10 feet away (in every direction) per OSHA
o Electrocution risk if straight stream contacts energized OCS
o Ensure that operating hose streams do not contact the OCS
• Fire ground apparatus placement
o Crews should preplan first due areas and plan apparatus placement around the light
rail
• Laying supply lines across tracks
o Treat as a water supply of last resort and avoid whenever possible
o If it is necessary to lay supply lines across the tracks, the Incident Commander will
need to communicate clearly to the Alarm Room that they are doing so, and advise
them to shut down light rail traffic for that section

PURPOSE
The removal of passengers from stalled elevators can present challenging and potentially
dangerous situations. Working around elevators may involve exposed machinery, open
hoistways, and high voltage electrical power sources. Following standard operational
procedures that ensure the safety of passengers and fire department personnel is of the utmost
importance and will reduce the chance of injury and potential damage to elevator equipment.
Incidents requiring the insertion of fire department personnel or the extrication of passengers
through the rooftop escape hatch will require a Technical Rescue Team response and lockout/tag-out measures to be in place.
PROCEDURE
Response
The fire department will only respond to stalled elevators occupied with passengers. A single
Engine Company or Ladder Company will be dispatched. If a medical emergency exists within
the elevator car, or in circumstances where the occupants are exposed to elevated summer
temperatures experienced in parking garages or exterior glass elevator cars, a Code 3 response
involving the first due Engine or Ladder with a TRT component will be dispatched.
Elevator Service Contractor ETA
The Alarm Room will ask the initial caller if they have contacted the elevator service contractor
for the building and note their ETA. Responses in many cases are 20-30 minutes during normal
business hours. This information should be factored into the incident action plan for removal of
occupants.
Elevator Car Location
The position of the elevator car can be determined from the elevator status panel in the fire
control room if available, or the floor level indication at the elevator bank. Occupants inside the
car may also be able to tell their location by the floor position indicator lights inside the car.
Communication with Occupants
Initial communication with occupants should occur as soon as possible to reassure them that
actions are being taken to remove them from the car and to determine if anyone inside has any
injuries or immediate medical issues. Information gathered from occupants should include:
• The number of occupants
• The indicated floor level
• Whether the emergency stop button has been mistakenly activated
• If the interior lights and fans are on

Recall Procedures (Phase 1)
Using the firefighters service operation key, found in the buildings fire control room or
emergency keys location, place the emergency recall key switch to the “ON” position (Phase 1)
(Fig. 1.3.1) to recall the elevator car to the main floor. *If the car is stalled due to a power outage
within the building, and the building is equipped with a standby or emergency power source, it
may be possible to run the elevators by turning the emergency recall switch in the main floor
lobby to the “ON” position. Use the manual elevator standby power selection switch (typically
located in the buildings fire control room) to bring the cars to the main floor, one at a time.

Power Reset
If recall procedures are unsuccessful, at least two crew members should be sent the elevator
mechanical room with building keys, flashlights, portable radio, and forcible entry tools, if keys
are unavailable. The remaining crew members should access the floor nearest the stalled car
and establish voice communications with the car occupants. Members in the mechanical room
will locate the power switch controls for the stalled elevator. The larger (208v-600v) switch
controls power to the elevator car and the smaller 120v switch controls the interior lights and
fans. In coordination with crew members at the car location, the larger (208v-600v) switch will be
shut down to the “OFF” position for 30 seconds then turned to the “ON” position to reset the
breaker. (Fig. 1.3.2) Once power is reestablished, the occupants will be directed to push a floor
button on the panel. If there is no response, the larger (208v-600v) power switch will again be
placed in the “OFF” position and remain off while the evacuation of the elevator takes place.
Crew members must remain in place in the mechanical room at the switch location until the
evacuation is complete or lock-out/tag-out is in place.

Opening Hoistway Doors
The position of the elevator car in relation to the floor level can be determined by slightly
separating the outer hoistway doors and looking in the gap for the bottom or top of the car.
If the car is at or near a landing (see figure 1.3.3), the hoistway doors may be unlocked and the
hoistway and car doors can be opened by hand using the following steps:
• Assure main 208v-600v power is secured in the “OFF” position from crew members in the
in the elevator mechanical room.
• Open the doors, access the car, and secure the emergency stop switch in the “STOP” or
“OFF” position.
• Assist occupants out of the car.

If the car is within 3 feet of the landing (see figure 1.3.4(a)), the hoistway doors will be locked
and will need to be accessed using the elevator interlock release key (drop key or crescent key)
using the following steps:
• Assure main 208v-600V power is secured in the “OFF” position from crew members in
the elevator mechanical room.
• Open the hoistway door using the appropriate elevator interlock release key and open the
car door by hand.
• Open the doors, access the car, and secure the emergency stop switch in the “STOP” or
“OFF” position.
• Place a barrier (ground ladder) across hoistway opening if the car is above the floor level.
• Assist occupants out of the car.

Forcible Entry
If hoistway doors cannot be unlocked by hand or the elevator interlock release key, the hoistway
door nearest to the stalled car can be forcibly opened using forcible entry tools. To assure safety
and minimize door damage, the following steps should be taken.
• Assure main 208v-600v power is secured in the “OFF” position from crew members in the
elevator mechanical room.
• Center opening doors should be forced with tools from the top of the doors where they
meet. Side opening doors should be forced from the side the door closes into.
• Place a barrier (ground ladder) across hoistway opening if the car is above the floor level.
• A crew member should access the car and secure the emergency stop switch in the
“STOP” or “OFF” position.
• Assist occupants out of the car.

MASS CASUALTY RESPONSE AND REUNIFICATION
M.P. 206.23

04/24-N

Page 1 of 2

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish the roles and responsibilities during a mass
casualty incident (MCI). It is at the discretion of the initial Incident Commander (IC) to determine
what constitutes a “mass casualty” incident. Upon recognition of an MCI, the initial IC will declare
to the alarm room the appropriate MCI alert, which will automatically activate additional internal and
external resources to support the incident.
DEFINITIONS
MCI 1- This designates an incident that requires a large number of resources to a primary scene,
i.e. a structure collapse. An MCI 1 will deploy a second alarm and MMRS to the scene.
MCI 2- This designates an incident that requires a large number of resources to a primary scene
and also to surrounding hospitals to assist with expected surge, i.e. active shooter/active threat.
An MCI 2 will deploy a second alarm and MMRS to the primary scene and one advanced life
support (ALS) unit and command vehicle (if available) to the three closest hospitals in perimeter
to the incident.
MCTRAC- Mass Casualty Tracking Reunification Arizona Collaborative. This collaborative is
made up of local, county, state, federal, and public and private partners to support all functions of
mass casualty response and reunification.
RESPONSIBILITIES
Initial IC: Establish command, determine the resource deployment needs based on a rapid initial
scene size-up, and request the appropriate MCI alert (MCI 1 or MCI 2). The MCI alert will
automatically activate additional internal and external resources to support the entire incident.
Responding Fire Companies: In mass casualty incidents, fire companies may be assigned to the
primary scene where the incident occurred or may be dispatched to local emergency rooms to assist
in patient triage and care. A triage may not be completed at the primary scene based on type,
magnitude, or complexity of the incident. Emergency medical services (EMS) roles and
responsibilities in an MCI 1 and MCI 2 are established in M.P. 203.01.
Dispatcher: Activate an MCI “pre-alert” based on preliminary law enforcement dispatch center
information. The MCI “pre-alert” will be sent to the MCI group text established in CAD and
includes all hospitals, emergency managers, and the Office of the Medical Examiners (OME). Upon
establishment of command by the initial IC, a “confirmation alert” with scene size-up information
will be sent to the MCI group to stand up all appropriate resources.

Page 2 of 2

Lead Dispatcher: Deploy the appropriate MCI deployment package requested by IC.
Emergency Manager: The Emergency Manager (EM) will activate the Emergency Operations
Center (EOC). Activation of the EOC requires notification to the Maricopa County Department of
Emergency Management’s (MCDEM’s) Duty Officer. The EM will provide contact information for
the Local Reunification Coordinator and the location for the family reunification center site to
MCDEM. MCDEM will activate the deployable reunification team to respond with the information
provided by the EM. All reunification efforts will be the responsibility of the EM with support
from internal and external partners established through MCTRAC.
POST INCIDENT MENTAL HEALTH
MCI incidents take an extreme toll on the general public and first responders. Mental health needs
should be assessed continuously during and after an MCI. Activation of crisis response teams will
be included with the MCI group’s “confirmation alert” and the deployable reunification team.
Mental health services should be used for victims, volunteers, and first responders to assist with
long-term recovery.

Response actions at a Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) incident can be divided into those
undertaken by operational responders and those undertaken or supervised by hazmat
technicians. Medical management includes decontamination, triage, treatment, behavioral
health and transportation. The specific WMD agent involved -- chemical, biological or
radiological -- has an impact on scene management. All WMD terrorism incidents are crime
scenes; police sector needs early establishment. Additional detail for WMD response
operations may be found in Phoenix Fire Department WMD Field Operations Guide (FOG).
FIRST ARRIVING UNITS
The first arriving officer will establish Command and begin a size-up. Survey visible activity,
signs and symptoms. Notice potential effects of wind, topography and location of the incident.
Route other responding companies away from visible hazards.
Command will establish level II staging whenever possible. Care must be taken to establish
staging in a safe area, taking into account the characteristics of the likely WMD agent (chemical,
biological, radiological).
Area Isolation/ Perimeter Establishment
I.

Command Size-up gathers information for incident management plan
•
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•

In known or suspected explosions when purposeful or terrorist activity cannot be ruled
out (i.e., natural gas explosion) initial actions should be to secure a hot zone perimeter
and call for the EOD (PD bomb squad) to respond.
Entry into the hot zone/crime scene should be under the direction of unified Command
with Haz Mat – radiological monitoring, Tech Rescue – secondary collapse, and EOD
secondary explosive devices/crime scene, issues being addressed.
If victims are present the Incident Commander should establish communication quickly
to control their anxiety and behavior. Select a fire member/officer (preferably paramedic)
as a point of communication to establish rapport and credibility. If possible all direct
communications to victims should be conducted/coordinated through this person.
A WMD/terrorist incident is a CRIME SCENE. Once fire/hazmat work is complete,
scene passes to FBI.
Remember any signs of WMD devices, dispersion apparatus, or other potential
evidence.
BE AWARE OF SECONDARY DEVICES designed to injure additional victims and/or first
responders. Upon sighting a device that appears operable, withdraw personnel until
Police Bomb Squad has inspected/rendered safe any suspicious appearing device.
Remember locations of potential evidence; do not move or collect it yourself.
Pay attention to symptoms exhibited by victims for relay to hazmat/paramedic personnel.
Prepare to Evacuate nearby area if indicated by wind, explosive or similar danger.

If fire is present and radiological agent suspected, evacuate to 2000 feet. Check
downwind areas for contamination.
IN THE CASE OF LETTER OR PACKAGE CONTAINING UNKNOWN SUBSTANCE:
¾ Quarantine persons in the immediate area of exposure (office or room) and
place them in a safe refuge area.
¾ Isolate the area that the substance or package is located; hold for Hazmat
Team to double bag and secure.
¾ Control Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems by shutting down to
prevent spread of contamination.
DO NOT USE SPECIFIC NAME OF SUSPECTED AGENT OVER THE
RADIO; USE ONLY ABIOLOGICAL AGENT@ OR AUNKNOWN AGENT@.
If a biological agent is contained in a single room or office in a multi-function
building, the building should be evacuated.

II. IF NO APPARENT VICTIMS, LIFE HAZARD, RESCUE SITUATION, OR FIRE EXIST, FIRE
DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL SHOULD NOT BE EXPOSED TO RISK.
First arriving units should secure a perimeter, evaluate the situation, and
await the arrival of the Hazardous Materials Technicians.
•

USE AVAILABLE PPE TO MINIMIZE SAFETY RISKS FOR OPERATIONAL
RESPONDERS.
Minimize entry of first responders into HOT ZONE.
Minimum PPE is turnouts, butyl rubber gloves and SCBA.

III. Establish Zones of Limited Access.
•

•

The HOT ZONE is the area immediately around the site/munition/device/source.
Enforce a single entry control point. All personnel entering this area must wear full
protective gear. The entry control point should be a minimum of 300 feet from the
source. This applies whether suspected agent is chemical, biological or radiological.
The WARM ZONE is upwind and uphill from the Hot Zone for Chemical and Radiological
Threats. Biological agents are non-volatile and controllable: if contained in a building
little downwind threat is posed; if release point is in the open, downwind hazard may
exist.

Hot Zone Support, Rescue, and Technical Decon personnel operate in WARM ZONE
with full protective gear. Decon lines are established in the WARM ZONE. This area
should be minimally 15 feet wide, but must encompass all victims awaiting decon and
decon equipment. A LOBBY SECTOR will be established at the entry to the warm zone
for accountability.
•

The COLD ZONE is outside the Warm Zone. For Chemical and Radiological agents,
COLD ZONE is uphill and upwind from Warm Zone. No contaminated personnel or
equipment should pass into the COLD ZONE. Incident Command, medical and
transportation are located in the COLD ZONE. Personnel should keep protective gear at
hand in case of wind shift or accidental contamination.

IV. COORDINATE WITH POLICE TO ESTABLISH SECURITY FOR SITE
•
•
•
•

Police will secure scene to insure safety for victims and emergency responders.
Police will search immediate area for presence of secondary devices.
If potentially explosive devices are sighted or suspected, Police Special Assignments
Unit will investigate and clear. Fire personnel will withdraw to safe staging area until
safe re-entry is possible. Fire personnel will NOT move or disarm suspected devices.
Victims and others will be denied entry and exit from HOT ZONE. Police will enforce
these restrictions. Fire personnel will NOT use physical force to restrain public.

Equipment Positioning
Position equipment upwind, uphill and upstream from the incident site. If the incident is indoors,
insure any ventilation exhaust ports are not blowing vapors into the established response areas.
Shut down HVAC systems to minimize contamination spread.
Assess Downwind Hazards
Be aware of the presence of, or potential for downwind, plumes. This threat exists for chemical,
biological and radiological [particles] agents. If a downwind hazard exists, initiate appropriate
action (evacuation or shelter-in-place) for those at risk. Adjust incident perimeters to account
for windage risks.
Gather Casualties/Initiate Victim Management
I.

Immediately begin process of gathering ambulatory victims.
•
•
•

Using an amplified PA system, direct victims to an established holding area to await
evaluation and emergency gross decontamination.

II. USE CAUTION [PPE] WHEN CONTACTING VICTIMS
•
•
•

Those exposed to CHEMICAL agents may be off-gassing.
BIOLOGICAL victims may be contaminated with particles or droplets of agent.
RADIOLOGICAL victims pose no danger; particles on skin or clothing brush or wash off.

III. NOTE LOCATIONS OF DEAD AT SCENE
•
•

HOT ZONE perimeter should be defined to include all dead bodies.
Unless absolutely necessary do not move bodies.

IV. NON-AMBULATORY VICTIMS SHOULD LIE IN PLACE
•
•

If necessary administer emergency medical measures WHILE WEARING PPE.
If external threat (building collapse, etc.) threatens, move victim(s) to safe area.

V. NOTE VICTIMS IN NEED OF RESCUE. Do not undertake rescue without PPE
VI. DEAD ANIMALS AND BIRDS AT THE SCENE
Deceased animals and birds at the scene will be handled as deceased people are handled,
expanding the Hot Zone to include their locations. Once scene operations have concluded,
Maricopa County Animal Control (MCAC) will be notified of the presence of deceased and
contaminated animals.
Emergency Decontamination
I.

Emergency decontamination for chemical agents should begin as soon as possible.
•

Emergency Decon serves three functions:
¾ Marks victims for easy identification
¾ Removes product/particles from victims
¾ Engages victims in activity that reduces anxiety.

Using PA system/bull horn, instruct victims on procedure:
¾ spread arms and legs wide; turn slowly so all parts of body are rinsed; clothing is
NOT removed for emergency decon unless patient was exposed to a liquid splash.
¾ Victims will be thoroughly wet using a booster line. Soak victims from top of head
downward with copious amounts of water.

•

In an event with multiple victims, which may inundate the booster line procedure of
emergency decontamination, a master stream(s) creating a dense shower flow should
be established as a more effective method of mass casualty emergency
decontamination.

II. Minimum PPE for decontaminating victims is turnouts and SCBA.
III. Locate Emergency Decon corridor Upgrade from HOT ZONE if possible. Notice direction
and impact of uncontrolled runoff for referral to clean-up.
Note: Emergency decontamination is not necessary for biological and radiological
contamination. ONLY victims who have other medical injuries that require immediate
medical attention should be prioritized and decontaminated as necessary.
HAZMAT UNITS
Hazmat Sector Establishment, Site Assessment
I. Command -- through Hazmat -- will make site assessment to:
•
•
•
•

assign levels of PPE;
confirm/adjust hot/warm/cold zones and incident perimeter; For Radiological Agent, HOT
ZONE is defined as area where survey instruments produce readings of 2 MR/hour and
higher;
confirm/adjust equipment placement.
reassess downwind hazards; implement evacuation/shelter-in-place as needed.

A Separate Technician Decon operation should be set up for response personnel away
from the victim decon lines.
Non-ambulatory and Special Needs Victims will be processed through decon lines with
assistance rendered as necessary by station attendants.
Decon of Deceased takes place AFTER ambulatory and non-ambulatory victims are
deconned, treated and transported.
If Federal response is not available, deceased victims may be decontaminated by Fire
Department personnel trained in stripping and decontamination of bodies before the
Maricopa County Medical Examiner’s Office assumes control of the body. Victims
who expire after decontamination (in the cold zone) will be held for the County Medical
Examiner’s Office.

Hazmat: Initial Entry
I.

Initial entry into the Hot Zone will be made by Hazmat Technicians.
•

•

For Chemical agents level A protection is worn. All personnel entering the Hot Zone will
carry THREE Nerve Agent Antidote Kits (MARK I) for self administration as needed.
For Biological agents, the level of protection is worn, as assigned by IC consulting with
HazMat and toxicologists/poison control.
For Radiological threats, minimum PPE is turnouts, butyl rubber gloves and SCBA;
XETEX dosimeters will be worn by all entering Hot Zone.

II. Two entry teams and appropriate backup teams will be established. One entry team will be
assigned to victim rescue and extrication. The second entry team will address agent
identification.
III. When victims are trapped, extrication, high angle rescue, trench rescue, or other technical
rescue may be used.
•
•

Extrication is conducted by the Extrication Sector of the Medical Branch, assisted by
other PFD special units. If special equipment or skills are demanded to achieve rescue,
PFD Technical Rescue Teams (TRT) will be used.
Non-ambulatory, but not trapped, victims located in the Hot or Warm Zones will be
handled only by personnel in appropriate PPE. Hot zone rescues only by Hazmat.

Hazmat: Agent Identification
I. All Chemical incidents will be treated as a Hazmat situation. The standard chemical
detection and air monitoring devices (i.e., HAZCAT) will be used during a response. If the
incident is suspected or confirmed to involve unconventional warfare chemicals, the
following list of detection devices (in conjunction with the standard equipment) will be used
for agent identification:
M-8 Chemical Detection Paper - chemical liquids
M-9 Chemical Detection Paper - chemical liquids
Dragger Colormetric Tubes - chemical vapors
M256 Chemical Detection Kit - chemical liquids and vapors
APD-2000 CW Detector - chemical vapors
In all cases where a chemical WMD is suspected, every available chemical detection device
will be used for secondary and tertiary confirmation of suspected chemicals.
II. For Biological incidents sampling is necessary and scene assessments will be undertaken
if equipment is available.
•

•
•

Hazmat teams will collect and test samples of any suspected Biological agent with the
appropriate field detection kit. Phoenix PD will transfer the sample to the Arizona
Department of Health Services (ADHS) State Laboratory for further testing and
identification.
Toxicology support is available at the scene and/or in the EOC through the Samaritan
Regional Poison Control Center.
Phoenix Police Department personnel will transport suspected biological agent samples
to the ADHS State Laboratory.

III. For Radiological incidents, Victoreen Instrument CDU-700 and Ludlum Model IIC
Radiacmeters will be used to identify the source of contamination and designate zones of
operation (Hot, Warm and Cold). The same instruments will be used to monitor personnel.
The Arizona Radiation Regulatory Agency (ARRA) will be notified to deploy teams to assist
with defining the extent of contamination.
Hazmat: Safety and Secondary Devices
I. Beginning with first at scene, all personnel will be cognizant of bombs and secondary
devices in their areas of operation. No PFD personnel should ever inspect or move a
suspected secondary device.

II. If operational personnel locate a suspected secondary device, the Hot Zone will be
expanded to include the device. All Fire personnel will withdraw from the area. Police
Bomb Technicians will enter the area to render the device safe. Once safety has been
established, PFD will resume operations.
III. If a secondary device is discovered by Hazmat technicians as they make entry into the Hot
Zone, they will withdraw from the area. PD bomb technicians will enter the area with PPE to
render the device safe. Fire operations will resume after safety has been established.
IV. The Phoenix PD bomb technicians will operate with two teams. The first team is an Entry
(Render Safe) Team. The second team is back-up to the Entry Team. If the threat is large
enough to demand the use of two PD entry teams, PFD Hazmat personnel, if available, will
provide a back-up rescue team to support PD operations in the Hot Zone.
MEDICAL MANAGEMENT
I. Whether the agent is chemical, biological or radiological, victims of a Weapons of Mass
Destruction/terrorist incident may present injuries caused by explosions, fire, falls, or other
mechanisms not directly related to the hazard agent itself. These can include cardiac
symptoms. As appropriate, treatment of such injuries should be initiated in the field.
II. For victims in a chemical incident, treatment protocols will follow established agent specific
guidelines. For nerve agents (sarin, soman, VX) Mark I Kits are used for adults; atropine
injections for pediatric. Oxygen is administered for choking agents. Amyl Nitrate (or sodium
nitrite or sodium thiosulfate) is given for Blood agents. Blister agents are given supportive
therapy for blisters plus pain medication.
III. For biological agent victims, it is possible that no symptoms may be present. If an agent is
positively identified, patients will be decontaminated and moved to hospitals or other
shelters for quarantine or observation.
IV. Victims of a radiological agent are unlikely to exhibit specific symptoms at the scene.
Exposure to ionizing radiation produces tissue and cell changes that are slow onset.
Radioactive particles are easily removed from skin and clothing. RADIATION EXPOSURE
ALONE IS NOT A MEDICAL EMERGENCY.
V. Treatment and triage are responsibilities of the IMS Medical Sector/Branch with information
from Hazmat. Extrication from the Hot Zone and decontamination is part of the Hazmat
Sector/Branch. In a small incident, Transportation may be a sector under the Medical
Branch; with a large number of victims.
VI. Command will assess scene stability and determine whether medical sector/branch is
located at the scene or away from the scene.

Triage
I.

The objective of triage is to sort victims so that the maximum number of lives may be
preserved through rapid and effective use of medical therapeutics.
•

S.T.A.R.T. (Simple Triage And Rapid Treatment) criteria will be used for triage, using
four classifications:
IMMEDIATE: requiring immediate treatment for survival;
DELAYED: not likely to be adversely affected by delay in treatment or movement to
definitive care;
MINOR: ambulatory and able to follow simple commands, may or may not require minor
treatment;
DEAD OR DYING.

II. The Arizona S.T.A.R.T. triage tag will be used for all patients. The tag shows patient
classification and also identifies injuries and treatments administered in the field, and
becomes the tracking base for patients.
•
•

In the event of a very large number of victims, triage may be indicated initially by
marking the priority on the patient’s forehead with the felt pen. In such cases, the triage
tag will be attached as soon as feasible.
Triage tag numbers are used for patient tracking; the triage tag becomes part of the
patient record after arrival at hospital. Triage tags remain attached to patients
transferred from the scene to the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) for forward
movement.

Treatment
I. Treatment areas will be established in the cold zone.
II. Medical treatment will address supportive needs of patients. Care for injuries (sustained in
explosions, fires, falls or other events related to the incident) collateral to WMD agent
exposure will be administered. Particular attention is reserved for airway/respiratory and
cardiovascular support. For all agents, patients will have experienced a terrorist event
demands attention be given to Behavioral Health issues.
Treatments administered at the scene will be guided by agent identification and medical
advise from toxicology/poison control personnel.
•

For chemical exposures, if agent is identified antidotes may be initially administered
during decon and continued in treatment area. Antidote choice and dose are agent
specific.

For biological agents, antibiotic or antitoxin administration may initiated after
decontamination as directed by toxicology/poison control.
For radiation exposures, symptomatic support is offered [no antidotes or efficacious
treatments exist].

III. For otherwise uninjured patients exposed to biological agents, if victim is nonsymptomatic, treatment may be confined to observation or initiation of antibiotics/antitoxins.
Command will determine if patients that are to be observed are transported to hospitals or to
shelters. Patients receiving initial antibiotic doses may be directed (by Command) to obtain
further antibiotics from public health authorities, from hospitals, or from private physicians.
Treatment Sector Officer may refer patients to Behavioral Health personnel and/or Police
Sector for interview.
IV. For otherwise uninjured, not contaminated and non-symptomatic patients exposed to
radiological agents, Treatment Sector Officer will review and
a. direct to treatment by a private physician;
b. refer to Police Sector for interview; and/or
c. refer to Behavioral Health personnel for interview.
V. For victims of chemical agents, exposed patients whether currently symptomatic or notrequire observation. Symptomatic patients require antidotes and supportive therapy. Nonsymptomatic patients, particularly those exposed to nerve or blister agents, may become
symptomatic within hours. Patients who can be confirmed as not exposed may be referred
by Treatment Sector Officer to Behavioral Health personnel and/or Police Sector for
interview.
VI. PHARMACEUTICALS will be brought to the incident scene with the responding Hazmat
teams or tox medic units. Additional Pharmaceuticals and equipment will be transported to
scene as needed.
VII. Specific treatment protocols for WMD agents are described in M.P. 201.14D.
Behavioral Health
I. Behavioral Health needs of victims will be addressed by Community Assistance Program
(Alternate Response) units (with call-up from TERROS, EMPACT and American Red Cross
as needed).
•

The mission of these personnel is to attend to the crisis mental health needs of victims
and responders, thereby assuring smooth operation and continuous flow of patients
through decontamination, treatment and transportation.

II. On scene, Behavioral Health Units may be assigned (in appropriate PPE) to
decontamination lines, in the treatment areas, and at the Transportation Sector to perform
their behavioral health functions.
III. Behavioral Health Units and personnel will be deployed to receiving hospitals to support
hospital behavioral health professionals in caring for short-term victim needs, including
debriefings. If mass shelters are established for victims, Behavioral Health personnel will
provide similar services at those locations. During the incident, Behavioral Health personnel
will be available to address short-term crisis needs of victim family members.
Transportation
I. The Transportation Sector/Branch moves patients from the scene to receiving hospitals or to
shelters as assigned by Command.
•
•

Only patients who have been decontaminated will be transported.
Zones will be designated in or near treatment areas to serve as collection points for
patients to be transported.

II. Ambulatory victims, once given initial assessment, decontamination and treatment, can be
transported en mass on designated vehicles (busses and other multiple patient transports).
Patients whose condition merits will be transported to medical facilities via ambulance. If
appropriate and such transport will not further disperse the agent, air transportation may be
used.
III. Decontaminated, uninjured patients may be released or transferred to mass shelter
locations as determined to be appropriate by Command. Names and contact information
will be recorded for all released individuals for any necessary post-incident follow-up as well
as behavioral health interviews.
IV. Some civilians present at the scene may not have experienced injury or exposure to a
chemical agent, and may not require decon. Witnesses may fall into this category. After
medical review, Command may direct such people to be documented and interviewed by
Police Sector. Behavioral Health personnel may also interview such victims to offer
assistance.
V.

Movement and loading of vehicles at the scene will be managed by Transportation
Sector/Branch, with security/support from the Police Department as appropriate. Acquisition
of additional vehicles and equipment will be handled through the Resource Sector/Branch.

VI. If the local hospital system is overwhelmed early in an incident, or treatment requires it,
patients may be moved to the NDMS Patient Reception Center (PRC). Patients will not be
transported from the scene until the Transportation Officer has confirmed that the PRC is
operational. The chain of treatment will be continued at the PRC until patients are placed on
aircraft. Patients transferred to NDMS will be tracked through their triage tags.
Hospitals
I.

Potential receiving hospitals will be notified immediately by dispatch (EMSystem and
MCMAS) upon determination that a WMD agent is involved in an incident.

II.

Receiving hospitals will engage lock-down status.

III. Hospitals will receive information on the probable (or identified) agent, decontamination
guidance, and recommendations on patient care from toxicology/poison control personnel
based in the City EOC. The priority will be to disseminate this information to receiving
hospitals first, and then to all area hospitals. Once established MCMAS and EMSystem will
enable simultaneous communication to all hospitals.
IV. Medical Branch will coordinate with the pharmaceuticals representative in the EOC , and
deliver appropriate drugs, antidotes and equipment (as adjuncts to those maintained at
hospitals) to receiving hospitals.
V.

Hospitals will assume responsibility for decontamination, triage and treatment of “walk in”
patients. This includes primary set-up of decontamination and maintenance of PPE for
hospital personnel. A PFD unit (with appropriate PPE) trained in decontamination set up
and procedures may be dispatched as scene demands de-escalate to each receiving
hospital to assist in decontamination of walk-ins. Hospitals will handle medical triage for
walk-ins and assume tracking responsibility for patients not processed through the scene.

VI. The Phoenix Police Department will dispatch units with appropriate PPE as necessary to
assist hospital security personnel in maintaining order at receiving facilities. This includes
isolation and management of self-referrals awaiting decontamination.
VII. Medical staff at receiving hospitals will determine patient treatment needs and the nature of
definitive care. A medical decision may be made to refer the patient to the NDMS for
transportation to definitive care. In this event, hospital transportation, supported as
appropriate by Fire Department ambulances, will be arranged to transfer the patient(s) to
NDMS at Sky Harbor International Airport. Hospital patients being moved who require
continuing care and/or treatment between the time of hospital departure and the time they
can be loaded on aircraft will obtain that treatment in the Patient Reception Center (PRC).

VIII. Individual hospitals will determine their patient capacity and coordinate that information with
the EOC and Transportation Sector at the scene. When a hospital closes due to
maximum patient load, victims will be transported to other receiving hospitals. In the event
all area hospitals become saturated (and alternate treatment areas are either full or not
established), victims from the scene will be transported to the NDMS receiving area at Sky
Harbor International Airport.
RECOVERY/RESTORATION ACTIONS
The recovery and restoration phase begins after the last living patients have been transported
from the scene. During this phase, it is expected that Federal response elements will arrive with
specialized teams and equipment. Federal resources will support hazard monitoring,
technical (equipment) and environmental decontamination, and site restoration.
Technical Decon of Response Personnel/Equipment and Shutdown
I.

Hazmat personnel continue to perform and/or supervise the technical personnel decon
corridor.

II. Hazmat personnel will establish and operate an equipment decontamination corridor to
support restoration of equipment needed to re-establish essential services.
III. Hazmat personnel will shut down the emergency decon operation and technical decon
corridors as they complete operation.
IV. Hazmat personnel will find/document uncontained runoff problems from decon corridors.
V. Equipment and protocol for personnel and equipment decontamination are described in
M.P. 204.14C.
Site Survey
I. To the extent possible, Hazmat personnel will continue to monitor all equipment and areas
suspected to be contaminated with available detection and identification devices. Hazmat
will coordinate with Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) for additional
monitoring assistance outside of the hot/warm zones.
II. Hazmat personnel will document all runoff areas, apparatus and other locations suspected or
identified as contaminated.

III. When biological agents are involved, Hazmat teams will continue to collect samples of
suspected contamination for evaluation by ADHS State Laboratory. PD will transport
samples from scene to laboratory.
IV. In radiological incidents, Hazmat personnel will coordinate with Arizona Radiation
Regulatory Agency to establish that equipment and site have been successfully
decontaminated.
V. For chemical agents, areas and equipment that cannot be accommodated in the technical
equipment decon corridor will be cleaned with a 5% bleach solution. A minimum solution
contact time of 15 minutes will be observed, then area or equipment will be thoroughly
rinsed and remonitored for contamination. The process will continue until monitoring
indicates no contamination is present.
VI. Hazmat personnel will provide technical assistance/support as requested to Maricopa
County, State, and/or Federal agencies engaged in restoration operations. Such agencies
will be operating under the Federal Response Plan.
Hazmat assist in transfer of deceased to County Medical Examiner
I. Deceased are to be left in hot zone unit all victims have been transported.
II. Maricopa County Medical Examiner’s Office, supported by Federal D-Mort Teams, will
examine bodies for evidence prior to decon. Decon may be supported by PFD Hazmat
personnel as requested.
III. Tracking, transportation and storage of bodies and belongings will be handled by the
Medical Examiner’s Office to insure preservation of chain of evidence custody.

The purpose of technical decontamination is to remove product/contaminates from personnel,
apparatus and equipment. Specific measures may vary slightly with the WMD agent, level of
contamination and circumstances of contamination. The Decontamination Sector Officer, through
Command, is responsible for determining the most appropriate decontamination procedures and
managing the decontamination process.
TECHNICAL DECON LINE PROCESS/STRUCTURE (PERSONNEL)
In an incident involving WMD/NBC three shelters will initially be constructed for grouped victims: Two
Ambulatory and a Special Needs/Non Ambulatory decontamination shelter for victims requiring
assistance, staffed by a male and female support group.

Treatment protocols described here include drugs and procedures that are administered
both by pre‐hospital (CEP) personnel and hospital personnel. Thus, some drug administrations
and procedures are outside the paramedic scope of practice.
The following treatment protocols have been reviewed by the PFD Medical Director, members
of the Board of Directors of Arizona Emergency Medical Services (the regional emergency
medical services association for physicians), and Maricopa County Public Health Department
Medical Director. Network hospital personnel (physicians) were also consulted in developing

Chlorine
Military Designation: CL
Description: Chlorine is found as an amber liquid or greenish‐yellow gas with a very
characteristic irritating, pungent odor. Chlorine is severely irritating to the skin, eyes, and
respiratory tract. Although generally stored as a liquid, when released, the resulting gas is
about two times heavier than air.
Non‐Military Uses: Chlorine is used widely in industrial settings in the organic synthesis and
manufacture of antifreeze agents, solvents, refrigerants, resins, bleaching agents, and other
inorganic chemicals. There is an exceptionally wide use of chlorine in non‐commercial and
home settings as a cleaning agent, bleaching agent, bacteriostatic, and disinfecting agent.
Storage of this substance in a variety of liquid and granular forms is widespread.

Treatment Protocol






General
o Chlorine is found as a greenish‐yellow gas, with a pungent, acrid, characteristic
odor. Sensitivity to the odor is below toxic levels; however, since some sensory
adaptation occurs, repeat exposures are more likely to produce toxic effects.
Exposures irritate eyes and central (upper) airways within minutes. Low doses
produce some cough and choking sensation. Moderate doses also produce a
sense of suffocation, hoarseness, and substernal pain. High doses also produce a
severe dyspnea, with pulmonary edema, nausea, vomiting, headache, syncope
also seen. Very high doses may produce sudden death without an obvious
pulmonary lesion, possibly via laryngospasm. All recognized exposures should be
referred for direct observation/care.
Patient Evaluation
o Victims should be immediately removed from the toxic environment by fully
masked personnel. Chemical protective clothing is required for liquid/solution
exposures.
o Liquid contamination causes eye and skin burns on contact. Contaminated
clothing should be removed/disposed of.
Treatment
o Eyes: Liquid exposures should be flushed with copious quantities of water. Gas
exposures, if symptomatic, should be flushed with water.
o Skin: Liquid exposures should be flushed with copious quantities of water;
contaminated clothing should be removed/disposed of. Gas exposures require
no specific therapy unless symptomatic. Intense gas exposure produces burns;
wash with water.
o Breathing: Evaluate respiration, cyanosis, bronchospasm.
 If apneic: CPR with intubation. Be aware that laryngospasm may be
present with intense exposures, hence intubation may be very difficult,
and surgical cricothyrotomy could be required. Medical attention should
be sought.
 If stridorous/hoarse: Consider intubation under direct vision since
laryngospasm may be imminent (see above). Medical attention should be
sought.

If dyspnea/cough/chest tightness: Consider intubation for impending
pulmonary edema. Also consider possible bronchospasm sufficiently
severe to have so little air exchange that wheezes are absent. Medical
attention should be sought. Codeine‐containing demulcents may help. Be
wary of sedation.
If bronchospasm: Provide aggressive bronchodilation:
o Adult:
 Inhaled albuterol: unit dose q 2 hr.
 Steroids: methyl prednisone, load 120 mg IV, then 60 mg q 6 hr.
 Theophylline: load 150 mg IV, then 30 mg/hr.
o Infants and children (0‐12 yr):
 Inhaled albuterol: 0.15 mg/kg per nebulized dose up to 5 mg/20
minutes for first 2 hr.
 Steroids: methyl prednisone: 1 mg/kg IV q 6 hr.
 Theophylline: 10 mg/kg IV/24 hr.
o Elderly:
 Inhaled albuterol: unit dose q 3 hr.
 Steroids: methyl prednisone, load 125 mg IV, then 60 mg q 6 hr.
 Theophylline (occasional use): load 100 mg IV, then 25 mg/hr.
If asymptomatic: Maintain direct observation for at least 1 hour; if
becomes symptomatic, treat as above. If still asymptomatic, continue to
recheck every hour for additional 12 hours since some bronchospasm
may appear late.
If hypoxic from bronchospasm, administer bronchodilators and
supplemental oxygen. If hypoxic from pulmonary edema: oxygen may be
utilized with positive pressure (ventilation after intubation).
If pulmonary edema occurs: Treat as noncardiac pulmonary edema (Adult
Respiratory Distress Syndrome or ARDS) with positive pressure
ventilation afterwards. Diuretic therapy is not indicated.
Inhalation exposures may produce pulmonary infiltrates, fever, and white
blood cell elevations leading to an erroneous diagnosis of (presumed
bacterial) pneumonia. Prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated.
Surveillance bacteriologic cultures are obtained anticipating an
approximate 50% risk of nosocomial pneumonia at days 3‐6.

Note: The anatomical configuration of infants' and children's airways
makes wheezing a less reliable indicator of bronchospasm. Severe small
airway constriction with resultant hypoxia may be present. Any apparent
infant or child respiratory distress should be immediately assessed with
oximetry.

Hydrocyanic Acid, Hydrogen Cyanide and Cyanogen Chloride
Military Designations: AC (hydrocyanic acid) and CK (cyanogen chloride)
Description: Both of these substances are liquids, but they vaporize (evaporate) at about 73/F
and 58/C, so they will be in the gaseous form under most temperate conditions. AC has an odor
of bitter almonds; CK is pungent. AC vapor is lighter than air, whereas CK gas is heavier than air.
Cyanogen chloride is quickly metabolized to cyanide once absorbed into the body and causes
the same biological effects as hydrogen cyanide. In addition, CK is irritating to the eyes, nose,
and throat (similar to riot control agents), whereas AC is nonirritating.
Non‐Military Uses: Large amounts of cyanide (most in the form of salts) are produced,
transported, and used by U.S. industry annually. Cyanide is used in fumigation, photography,
extraction of metals, electroplating, metal cleaning, tempering of metals, and the synthesis of
many compounds. It is released when synthetic fibers and plastics burn.
Treatment Protocol


General
o Patient should be removed from the toxic environment immediately.
o These substances are very volatile, so there is little need for decontamination if
exposure was to vapor alone. If liquid was present, remove patient’s clothing;
wash liquid off skin.
o The effects of vapor from either form of cyanide appear within seconds to a
minute. If patient has no or only mild effects when seen 5 to 30 minutes after
exposure, he/she will need no treatment.
o Severe cyanide poisoning produces metabolic acidosis. If cyanide poisoning is
suspected in a patient who does not have moderate or severe acidosis,
treatment for cyanide poisoning should not be delayed, but the diagnosis should
be reconsidered

Patient evaluation (Level of consciousness, respiratory rate, heart rate)
o Exposure to high concentration: transient hyperpnea, followed by convulsions
(30 seconds after exposure), gradual decrease in respiratory rate and depth to
apnea (3‐5 minutes) and cessation of cardiac activity (5‐8 minutes).
o Exposure to lower concentration: flushing, headache, anxiety, agitation, vertigo,
feeling of weakness, nausea, muscular trembling (cyanogen chloride may cause
irritation of eyes, nose, and airways). Prolonged exposure may lead to effects
listed above.
o Odor of bitter almonds may be detected (half of the population cannot smell
this); normal pupils (may be dilated in terminal stage); cherry‐red skin (may not
be present); diaphoresis; venules in fundus are same color as arterioles; cyanosis
occurs only after circulatory collapse and apnea.
Treatment
o For a mild exposure (conscious and breathing): observe; no antidotes; oxygen
may be given to young or old or in presence of heart disease in a patient with
mild symptoms.
o Severe exposure (unconscious, not breathing): should immediately receive 100%
oxygen. Cardiac monitoring and evaluation of oxygen saturation should be done
when possible. (Saturation will be normal even in severe casualty until terminal
stage; however, additional oxygen may assist in therapy.) Antidotes should be
administered as soon as possible (see below). It is important to note that pulse
oximeter results are completely unreliable in the setting of methemoglobinemia,
which is induced by amyl nitrite or sodium nitrite therapy.
 For a severe exposure: ventilate using bag‐valve‐mask with one ampule
of amyl nitrite (crushed) in bag; after several minutes, add another
(crushed) ampule; keep adding an ampule every several minutes. This is a
temporary measure until IV drugs can be given, but it may assist in
recovery.
 Administer 300 mg (10 ml) of sodium nitrite IV over 5 minutes. Flush line.
[Children's dose: 0.2‐0.3 ml/kg, or 6‐9 mg/kg of the 3% solution. No
separate recommendation for infants.
 For elderly, use adult dose unless they are small and frail.] Be aware:
Nitrites produce orthostatic hypertension, but a patient who can stand
unaided does not need nitrite therapy.

Follow with 12.5 grams (50 ml) of sodium thiosulphate IV. [Children's
dose: 0.4 mg/kg, or 1.65 ml/kg of the 25% solution. No separate
recommendation for infants. Adult dose should be used for elderly unless
they are small and frail. Use care giving nitrite in a patient with
hypertension or heart disease.] (Amyl nitrite, sodium nitrite, and sodium
thiosulfate are in the Pasadena (formerly Lilly) Cyanide Antidote Kit, the
latter two in ampules of 300 mg/10 ml and 12.5 grams/50 ml. Use one‐
half dose in 20 minutes if no improvement. See instructions on top of
Antidote Kit box.
o If patient continues to remain apneic, intubate and continue oxygen through
tube with assisted ventilation.
o Transfer apneic or unconscious patients to medical facility.
o Patients often recover rapidly unless CNS hypoxia has occurred.
Methyl Isocyanate, Methylene, Bisphenyl Isocyanate, and Methylene Dilsocyanate MDI
Military Designations: None
Description: Methylene Bisphenyl Isocyanate (MDI) is found as a solid in white to yellow flakes.
Various liquid solutions are used for industrial purposes. There is no odor to the solid or the
liquid solutions. The vapor is approximately eight times heavier than air. This chemical is a
strong irritant to the eyes, mucus membranes, skin, and respiratory tract. This chemical is also a
very potent respiratory sensitizer.
Non‐Military Uses: Very large quantities of MDI are produced, transported, and used annually
in the United States. Various industrial processes utilize MDI in production and usage of
(poly)urethane foams, lacquers, and sealants. MDI is a commonly used precursor in the
industrial production of insecticides and laminating materials. Noncommercial uses of
polyurethanes such as in isocyanate paints or in cutting of uncured urethanes may also cause
exposure. Thermal degradation of these substances may produce MDI as a combustion by‐
product.

Treatment Protocol






General
o MDI is found as a solid, which has a melting point of 37 degrees C. Vapor
exposures occur with liquids containing dissolved solid. Gas exposures may occur
with high‐temperature volatilization. Thermal decomposition produces carbon
monoxide and oxides of nitrogen. Sensitivity to this substance (eye, nose
irritation) occurs at concentrations five times higher than OSHA limits (0.2
mglm3); hence toxic exposures may go unrecognized.
o Exposures lead to:
 Sensitizing effects: Respiratory sensitization may occur, particularly in
individuals with known asthma, allergies, or recognized isocyanate
sensitivity (e.g., TDI).
 Irritant effects: Eyes, mucous membranes and skin may be irritated,
particularly with prolonged, repetitive, or intense exposures. High
concentrations may also produce cough, dyspnea, and lethal pulmonary
edema.
Patient Evaluation
o Victim should be immediately removed from the toxic environment by personnel
in chemically protective clothing. Vapor or gas hazards should be anticipated
with full (positive pressure) masks. Liquid/solid contamination should be
corrected by clothing removal and soap and water decontamination.
Treatment
o Eyes: There is no specific therapy appropriate. Liquid/solid exposures should be
irrigated with copious quantities of water. Subsequently, symptomatic
individuals should seek medical attention.
o Skin: There is no specific therapy appropriate. Liquids/solids should be removed
with soap and water. Single exposures are unlikely to create rashes unless
previously sensitized. Intense exposure may produce a dermatitis and require
referral.
o Swallowing: Liquids/solids should be removed by induced vomiting in the
conscious victim or by lavage otherwise.
o Breathing: Symptoms due to sensitivity may be delayed up to 8 hr after
exposure. Respiratory symptoms may appear with skin, ocular or GI exposure in
previously sensitized individual.
 If apneic: CPR, may require intubation for pulmonary edema. Consider
severe bronchospasm in previously sensitized victim.
 If stridorous/hoarse: Consider intubation under direct vision.

If dyspnea/cough/chest tightness: Consider intubation for impending
pulmonary edema. Also consider possible bronchospasm sufficiently
severe to have so little air exchange that wheezes are absent. Medical
attention should be sought. Codeine‐containing demulcents may help. Be
wary of sedation.
 Note: The anatomical configuration of infants' and children's airways
makes wheezing a less reliable indicator of bronchospasm. Severe smaller
airway constriction with resultant hypoxia may be present. Any apparent
infant or child respiratory distress should be immediately assessed with
oximetry.
 If bronchospasm: Treat as asthma with inhaled albuterol. Bronchospasm
may be particularly severe, especially in previously sensitized individuals.
o Treat aggressively:
 Adults:
o Inhaled albuterol: unit dose q 2 hr or continuous neb 15 g/hr.
o Steroids: methylprednisolone load 250 mg IV, then 80 mg q 6 hr.
o Theophylline: load 150 mg IV, then 30 mg/hr.
 Infants and children (0‐12 yr.):
o Inhaled albuterol: 0.15 mg/kg per nebulized dose up to 5 mg/20
minutes for first 2 hr.
o Steroids: methylprednisolone; 1 mg/kg q 6 hr.
o Theophylline: 10 mg/kg IV/24 hr.
 Elderly:
o Inhaled albuterol: unit dose q 3 hr.
o Steroids: methylprednisolone load 125 mg IV, then 60 mg q 6 hr.
o Theophylline (occasional use): load 100 mg IV then 25 mg/hr.
o Upper airway obstruction: This is very rarely seen and only with intense
exposures. Hoarseness and stridor suggest impending laryngospasm; consider
intubation under direct vision.
 If pulmonary edema (may rarely occur with intense exposures): Treat as
non‐cardiac pulmonary edema (Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome or
ARDS see PHOSGENE).
 If hypoxia (commonly from bronchospasm, rarely from pulmonary
edema): Treat with above bronchodilation and oxygen.
 If cough: Codeine‐containing demulcents (tissue‐soothing agents) may
help. Be wary of sedation.

Mustard (Sulfur Mustard)
Military Designations: H; HD; HS
Description: Mustard is a “blister agent” that causes cell damage and destruction. It is a
colorless to light yellow to dark brown oily liquid with the odor of garlic, onion, or
mustard. It does not evaporate readily but may pose a vapor hazard in warm weather. It
is a vapor and liquid hazard to skin and eyes, and a vapor hazard to airways. Its vapor is
five times heavier than air.
Non‐Military Uses: Sulfur mustard has been used as a research tool to study DNA damage and
repair. A related compound, nitrogen mustard, was the first cancer chemotherapeutic
agent and is still used for some purposes.
Treatment Protocol




General
o Mustard causes no immediate effects. The initial clinical effects of mustard
(which usually involve the eyes, the skin, and the airways) appear 2 to 24 hours
(usually 4 to 8 hours) after exposure to liquid mustard or to mustard vapor.
However, liquid or vapor mustard penetrates the skin and mucous membranes
and damages cells within minutes of exposure, so decontamination must be
done immediately after exposure.
o The patient should be immediately removed from the toxic environment.
o If liquid contact, clothing should be removed, and skin decontaminated with
soap and cool water, or thoroughly flushed with water alone. Eyes should be
flushed with large amounts of saline. If exposure is to vapor alone, remove
clothing.
o If there is a history of definite exposure, patient should be taken to medical
facility for observation.
Patient evaluation: Initial effects (usually 2 to 24 hours after exposure)
o Eyes: irritation, feeling of grit in eye, redness.
o Skin: erythema (will progress to blisters 1 to 4 hours later if exposure was large).
o Airways: irritation of nose, voice change, sinus pain, hacking cough. (Very rarely a
patient might inhale an extremely large amount and start to have these effects
plus dyspnea within 2 hours. This patient should be intubated, and assisted
ventilation with oxygen should be started. This patient should be taken to the
nearest appropriate hospital as quickly as possible.)

Page 10 of 13

Treatment
o There is nothing to do for these patients until effects appear except to
decontaminate. Tissue is damaged within minutes, so decontamination must be
done immediately.
o Eyes: Any commercial eye solution may relieve the irritation from a mild
exposure. More severe effects: A mydriatic b.i.d. or q.i.d. (depending on the
length of action of the drug): a topical antibiotic b.i.d.; Vaseline on lid edges
b.i.d.; sunglasses if photophobia is present. Topical steroids within the first 24
hours only may reduce inflammation. Control pain with systemic, not topical,
analgesics. Visual loss is usually due to lid edema and blepharospasm, not eye
damage.
o Skin: A soothing lotion (e.g., calamine) for erythema. Leave small blisters intact.
Unroof large blisters and irrigate denuded area at least t.i.d. followed by liberal
application of topical antibiotic. Watch for infection. Fluid requirements are
much less than those for thermal burns; do not overhydrate.
o Airways: Steam inhalation and cough suppressants will generally relieve mild
symptoms. A chemical pneumonitis (increased temperature, white blood count;
chest x‐ray findings) may develop after large exposure: intubation, assisted
ventilation with oxygen (and possibly with PEEP or CPAP); bronchodilators;
watch sputum at least daily for organisms (no antibiotics until organism is
identified)
o Systemic absorption of a large amount of mustard may cause bone marrow and
gastrointestinal tract damage. Watch WBC, Hct daily; mustard damages bone
marrow.

Nerve Agents
Tabun (GA); Sarin (GB); Soman (GD). None for GF and VX
Military Designations: GA, GB, GD, GF and VX
Description: Nerve agents are very toxic organophosphorus compounds that have biological
activity similar to that of many insecticides. Their volatilities range from that of water to that of
motor oil; they present a hazard from vapor and liquid. Under temperate conditions, the liquids
are clear, colorless, and mostly odorless. They cause biological effects by inhibiting
acetylcholinesterase, thereby allowing acetylcholine to accumulate and cause hyperactivity in
muscles, glands, and nerves.

Non‐Military Use: There is no non‐military use. Threat of human exposure exists in research
laboratories, in storage facilities, and from terrorists.
Treatment Protocol




General
o Nerve agents are extremely toxic chemicals that cause effects by inhibiting the
enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing excess acetylcholine to accumulate. This
excess neurotransmitter then produces overstimulation and causes hyperactivity
in muscles, glands and nerves the nerve agents are GA (Tabun), GB (Sarin), GD
(Soman), GF, and VX. Their effects are identical.
o Remove patient from contaminated atmosphere. If exposure was to vapor,
remove clothing; if exposure was to liquid; remove clothing and wash skin with
soap and water, or thoroughly flush with water alone.
Patient evaluation
o If patient is conscious, note ventilatory status and ask about nausea. If
unconscious, note ventilatory status and heart rate (heart rate may be high, low,
or normal in a nerve agent casualty).
o Initial effects differ depending on whether exposure was to vapor or to liquid.
o Vapor: Effects start within seconds to a minute or two.
 Mild to moderate: Miosis, possible redness in eye, eye pain, complaints
of dim or blurred vision, nausea, rhinorrhea, excess secretions, dyspnea
(mild to severe).
 Severe: Loss of consciousness, seizures, apnea, flaccid paralysis.
o Liquid: Effects start in minutes (large exposure) to 18 hours (small exposure)
after an asymptomatic interval.
 Mild to moderate: Sweating and fasciculations at site of exposure;
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; weakness.
 Severe: Same as for vapor, but after a 1‐ to 30‐minute asymptomatic
interval.

Treatment
o Initial Management
 Mild to moderate: Dyspnea should be treated with one or two doses of
atropine IM or IV and 1 dose of pralidoxime (IV drip) initially, depending
on severity of the dyspnea. (See paragraph B below for size of dose.) This
should be supplemented with oxygen, particularly in infants, young
children, and the elderly; healthy older children and adults will usually do
well without it unless they have pulmonary or cardiac disease. Atropine
dose should be repeated at 5‐to 10‐minute intervals until improvement is
noted. Failure to respond, (i.e., no dry mouth, no decrease in secretions)
confirms the need to administer additional doses of atropine.
Gastrointestinal effects after liquid exposure are treated in the same
manner. Do not treat for miosis (unless eye pain is severe) or rhinorrhea
(unless severe).
 Severe: Administer three doses of atropine IM (not IV in hypoxic patient)
and start one dose of pralidoxime by slow (20 minutes) IV drip. (More
rapid administration will cause hypertension.) (See paragraph B below for
size of dose.) Intubate and ventilate with oxygen (initial ventilation will be
difficult because of airway resistance; atropine will relieve this).
Administer diazepam if convulsing. Suction for secretions. Repeat 1 dose
of atropine (IM until hypoxia is improved, then IV) every 5 minutes until
(a) secretions diminish or (b) airway resistance is less or is normal. Failure
to respond, ( i.e., no dry mouth, no decrease in secretions) confirms the
need to administer additional doses of atropine. Monitor via pulse
oximeter; cardiac monitoring should also be done (cardiac arrhythmias
are uncommon after atropine is given). Acidosis may develop after
seizures or after period of hypoxia and will require therapy. This patient
should be transported to a hospital after stabilization (adequate drug
therapy and initiation of ventilation).
 Eyes: Do not treat miosis unless eye/head pain is severe. Use topical, not
systemic, anticholinergic to relieve pain.
o Recommended Doses
Atropine:
 Older child and adult: 2 mg
 Infant and young child: 0.02 mg/kg
 Elderly: Use adult dose unless cardiac or pulmonary disease is present, or
patient is small or frail; in latter instances, use 1 mg as standard, but be
prepared to administer additional amounts more frequently.

Page 13 of 13

Pralidoxime (2‐PAM):
 Older child and adult: 1 gram
 Infant and young child: 25‐50 mg/kg
 Elderly: Adult dose unless cardiac or renal disease is present, patient has
hypertension, or patient is small and frail; decrease dose by half in these
patients but administer the other half 1 hour later if patient has not
improved. Pralidoxime can cause hypertension when given rapidly IV.
Slow administration over 20 minutes will minimize the hypertensive
effect. After rapid administration, hypertension can be rapidly but
transiently reversed by phentolamine (adult: 5 mg IV. child: 1 mg, IV).
o Further Care
 Mild to moderate: After vapor exposure, a patient who is breathing
normally does not need to be hospitalized as he will not worsen.
However, miosis should be followed until eyes are normal (4 to 6 weeks).
After liquid exposure, a patient should be observed in hospital for 18
hours until all agent is absorbed from skin.
 Severe: Continue to ventilate and to administer atropine following
guidelines above. Treat acidosis if present. If patient has not had
prolonged hypoxia, recovery of an unconscious patient will be gradual
over l to 3 hours.

Page 1 of 1

Purpose
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the process for initiating the review of Phoenix
Regional Standard Operating Procedures (PRSOP).
Policy
The Phoenix Fire Department, with consideration from the Regional Operations Consistency
Committee (ROCC), is responsible for the management of the PRSOP index as well as the M.P.
Review Cycle. The M.P. Review Cycle is the ongoing review time frame identified for each
procedure. Procedures are scheduled for review on a five-year cycle. Additionally, procedures
may require review or revision secondary to training/studies/operations etc. before the 5-year
review date.
Procedure
The Scheduled Review Date is the deadline for a procedure to complete the review process.
The review of PRSOP’s should begin 3-6 months prior to the Scheduled Review Date. The
Phoenix Fire Department, with consideration from the ROCC, is responsible for initiating
procedural reviews and making the necessary revisions to keep PRSOP’s current. A review of a
procedure may involve the following:
1. Revision of a procedure
2. Rewrite of a procedure
3. Addition of a new procedure
4. Deletion/removal of a procedure
5. Validation of a procedure
A revised date and the next scheduled review date shall be updated on Fire Point upon a
procedure’s completion of the review process.
