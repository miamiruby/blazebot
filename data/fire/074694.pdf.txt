The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines for handling large-scale events during and after fire
ground mitigation. These incidents could include multiple alarm fires, fires involving hazardous materials, major
spills, leaks, and other significant events that may result in environmental contamination or have a major impact
on the operation of City services. Many times the process of handling large-scale fires and associated
environmental impacts, especially those involving hazardous materials, is much more involved and time
consuming than the actual extinguishment of the fire.
