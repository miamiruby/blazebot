Operational Information
In Level 1 Staging situations, first arriving Engine, Ladder or Heavy Rescue, and Rescue
companies will perform these functions as required and ordered by Command.
Company Officers will determine based upon conditions and the Risk Management Plan, the
priority of the functions for their company unless otherwise ordered by Command. This does
not limit a company to only its listed functions. Every company will be expected to perform all
basic functions safely within the limits of their capability, and it will be the on‐going
responsibility of Command to integrate tasks and functions as required with the on‐scene units.

In the absence (or delay) of Ladder company response, Command should assign ladder
functions to a Heavy Rescue or an Engine company. For example, Command may assign an
Engine company to perform salvage or overhaul. The assignment of these basic operations
represents a standard fireground plan for task and tactical operations designed to improve the
effectiveness and safety of all units working together. This plan should in no way limit the
initiative of any officer and should enhance the decision‐making process of all officers by
establishing a standard operational framework.
