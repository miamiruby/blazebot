The purpose of technical decontamination is to remove product/contaminates from personnel,
apparatus and equipment. Specific measures may vary slightly with the WMD agent, level of
contamination and circumstances of contamination. The Decontamination Sector Officer, through
Command, is responsible for determining the most appropriate decontamination procedures and
managing the decontamination process.
TECHNICAL DECON LINE PROCESS/STRUCTURE (PERSONNEL)
In an incident involving WMD/NBC three shelters will initially be constructed for grouped victims: Two
Ambulatory and a Special Needs/Non Ambulatory decontamination shelter for victims requiring
assistance, staffed by a male and female support group.
NOTE: Optimally, the Technical Decontamination Setup will be operated by six technicians
Station #1 - Personal Belongings Drop/Victim Accountability
Personnel Requirements: two station attendants
Equipment requirements: one large container, M256 Chemical Detection Kit, M8 chemical detection
paper; Drager System; APD 2000 Chemical Agent Monitor; Victorian instrument CDU-700 and Ludlum
Model IIC Radiacmeters plastic bags, triage tags and markers, and a container with soapy water,
clipboard and pen.
Attendant #1 will have personnel tag and deposit all critical personal belongings (wallets, keys,
identifications, money, purses etc.) into the large container. Attendant #2 will transfer the critical
personal belongings into plastic bags and test for contamination with the appropriate sampling device
based on the identified threat. If contents are contaminated, the attendant will decontaminate with
soapy water and then re-monitor. Once the personal belongings are free of contamination, they will be
moved to the exit point of the decontamination line for re-issue to the owners. For biological
substances, MMRS toxicology personnel will provide guidance for re-issue. For victim accountability,
attendant #1 will record names as individuals enter the technical decontamination procedure. A Start
triage tag will be used for each individual.
Station # 2 - Clothing Removal
Personnel Requirements: 1 station attendant
Equipment requirements: 1 large container and plastic bags.
Attendant #3 will have personnel remove all their clothing and deposit it into the lined container. Once
the container is full, the bags will be sealed. These bags will be stored in the personal belongings
check/decontamination area until all victims are processed.
Station # 3 - Shower
Personnel Requirements: 1 station attendant

Equipment requirements: 2 shower systems, soapy water, sponge.
Attendant will have personnel enter the shower and ensure they wash all parts of their body paying
particular attention to their hair and body folds. Attendant will have victims wash off any suspected
contamination with soapy water and sponge, then re-rinse.
Station # 4 - Monitoring
Personnel Requirements: 1 station attendant
Equipment Requirements: M8 chemical detection paper; APD 2000 Chemical Agent Monitor; Victorian
instrument CDU-700 and Ludlum Model IIC Radiacmeters.
Station attendant will monitor with the appropriate detection device for the identified contaminant. If
any contamination is detected, the person will move back into the shower and rewash, then be
retested. Once victims are tested and determined to be free of contamination, they will be sent forward
to the clothing issue area.
Station # 5- Clothing issue/Redress
Personnel Requirements: 1 station attendant
Equipment requirements: Appropriate number of hospital scrubs and thongs for all personnel
processing through decontamination
Attendant will issue the appropriate sized hospital scrubs and thongs to each person and have them
redress.
The Decontamination Sector Officer will release individuals who have been processed through the
decontamination corridor to the Medical Sector staff for further evaluation. This includes all emergency
response personnel, civilians and patients. The Decontamination Sector Officer will determine when it
is appropriate to release custody of clothing, personal effects and equipment after consulting the
Treatment Sector Officer.

TECHNICAL DECON LINE PROCESS/STRUCTURE (EQUIPMENT)
Station #1 - Initial Wash
Personnel Requirements: 1 station attendant
Equipment requirements: Appropriate booster lines and nozzles
Station attendant will spray the vehicle and/or equipment for two to three minutes with water. Hot
water, if available, is more effective at removing residual contaminants. Although undersurfaces are
difficult to reach, they must be sprayed.
Station #2 - Decon Solution Application
Personnel Requirements: 1 Station attendants
Equipment Requirements: Spray devices, 5% Chlorine bleach solution, brushes
Station attendant will apply the decon solution to all areas of the equipment suspected of being
contaminated. Make special effort to apply decon solution to undercarriage of vehicles driven in or
through a contaminated area, particularly apparatus used in emergency gross decontamination.

Station #3 - Wait (Solution Contact Time)
Personnel Requirements: 1 Station Attendant
Equipment Requirements: Spray devices, 5% Chlorine bleach solution, brushes
Station attendant will allow the solution to stay on the vehicles/equipment for a minimum of fifteen
minutes. Throughout the wait time, the attendant will observe the equipment and re-spray areas that
dry from sunlight, heat or evaporation.
Station #4 - Rinse
Personnel Requirements: 1 Station attendants
Equipment Requirements: Appropriate booster lines and nozzles
Station attendant will spray vehicles and/or equipment for two to three minutes, paying particular
attention to undersurfaces.
Station #5 - Equipment Monitoring
Personnel Requirements: 1 station attendants
Equipment Requirements: M8 chemical detection paper; Drager System; APD 2000 Chemical Agent
Monitor; Victorian instrument CDU-700 and Ludlum Model IIC Radiacmeters
Station attendant will use the appropriate detection device to monitor for complete
removal/neutralization of the identified contaminant. If Federal Agencies on the scene provide
additional certification of decontamination, their process/requirements will be accommodated.
