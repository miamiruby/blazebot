SCOPE
This procedure establishes a standard structure and guideline for all fire department personnel
operating at incidents involving trench rescue operations. The procedure outlines
responsibilities for first-responders, TRT units, Command Officers, and other fire department
personnel responding to such incidents. All other Phoenix Fire Department procedures shall
apply to trench rescue operations where applicable.
PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines for the response of fire department
personnel and equipment to trench rescue incidents. Because trench rescue operations present
a significant danger to fire department personnel, the safe and effective management of these
operations require special considerations. It shall be the policy of the Phoenix Fire Department
that NO personnel shall be allowed into an unsafe trench or excavation. This procedure
identifies some of the critical issues which must be included in managing these incidents.
TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
OSHA Regulations Standard 29 CFR 1926 Subpart P regulates excavations for general industry
and the rescue service and shall be considered the basis for emergency trench rescue
operations. For the purpose of emergency response, an excavation shall be defined by any
depression, hole, trench, or earth wall, man made or natural, of four feet or greater.
Trench collapses generally occur due to unstable soil conditions combined with improper or
inadequate shoring. The potential for additional collapse is considered a primary hazard to
personnel. Removing soil or debris, adding weight near the edge of an open cut, vibration (such
as vehicle movement), rain, or simply the passage of time, may cause additional collapse at any
time during the rescue operation.
Due to the inherent dangers associated with these operations, the Phoenix Fire Department
Risk Management Profile shall be applied to all trench rescue operations and shall be
continuously re-assessed throughout the incident. A phased approach to trench rescue
operations which include; Arrival, Pre-entry operations, Entry operations, and Termination, can
be utilized to safely and effectively mitigate these high-risk / low-frequency events.

Additional technical information is available in the issued Technical Rescue Field
Operations Guide.

based on the survivability profile of the victim(s) which include factors such as the
location and condition of the victim(s), and elapsed time since the accident occurred.
I. MAKE THE GENERAL AREA SAFE
A. Establish a hazard zone perimeter 50 feet from the collapse area.
•
•

•
•
•
