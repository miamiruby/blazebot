The following policy regulates the dispatch, response and use of water tender apparatus.
All company officers will use their discretion in calling for water tender assistance and should be alert to
areas in their response zones that will require the additional water carried on water tenders.
Company officers having a water tender assigned to their station can take the water tender with their
engine (but not in lieu of) when the water tender is needed due to limited water supply. This procedure
is not intended to provide for the use of water tenders as two-piece companies where a water supply is
readily available.
In addition to the above, a water tender may be special called to any incident where required.
Command will specify either a water tender with driver only, or a full crew. When a full crew is
requested, the assigned company will respond with the water tender plus their regular apparatus unless
otherwise instructed. When a water tender is requested with a driver only, the Company officer is
responsible to assign a qualified driver/pump operator.
If the company housed with the closest available water tender is not in quarters, Alarm will dispatch an
available company to pick up the water tender and respond.
The water tender will always retain its home station identification regardless of the assigned crews.
Example: "Engine 30 responding with water tender ( ).
Personnel assigned to stations housing water tenders will maintain and service the water tenders in
accordance with the Phoenix Fire Department Operations Manual, Volume III, Section 3. Companies
assigned to respond with a water tender will service, clean and restore the apparatus to an acceptable
standard condition of readiness upon completion of the incident.
Engineers may be assigned to water tenders on Constant Manning basis during periods of heavy brush
fire activity.
