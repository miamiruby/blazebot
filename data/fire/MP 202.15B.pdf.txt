PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish a standard deployment for wildland-urban interface fire
incidents.
DEFINITIONS
Wildland-urban interface is defined as the zone of transition between wildland (or unoccupied land) and
human development.
POLICY
A growing number of fire departments within the Central Arizona Life Safety Response Council
(CALSSRC) face the problem of protecting the wildland-urban interface. Fire Departments must
continue to focus on the unique fire protection challenges associated with the wildland-urban interface.
Through a systematic process of pre-incident planning, Company Officers are responsible for the
identification of areas within their first-due that are at risk for an urban-interface fire incident. These
areas should be reported to their Battalion Chief for identification in the CAD system. Once entered
into the CAD system, any reported brush fire incident will have an urban-interface assignment
deployed by the dispatch center.
The following resources will be dispatched for an urban-interface incident:
URBAN-INTERFACE ASSIGNMENT:
• 5 – Engines
• 1 – Ladder
• 3 – Brush Trucks
• 2 – Tenders
• 2 – Command Officers
• 1 – Rescue (or ambulance)
• 1 – Shift Commander
• 1 – CXX19
FIRST ALARM URBAN-INTERFACE:
• 8 – Engines
• 2 – Ladders
• 5 – Brush Trucks
• 4 – Tenders
• 2 – Rescues (or ambulance)
• 3 – Command Officers
• 2 – Shift Commanders
• 1 - CRV
• 1 - Safety Officer

OPERATIONAL INFORMATION
Some Fire Departments within the CALSSRC staff Brush Trucks with a 4-person crew including a
Company Officer. For the purposes of deployment, these Units shall have the designation of Brush
Engine in the CAD system. A Brush Engine may be assigned by the Incident Commander to assume
the responsibilities of Sector Officer (like any other Fire Company).
A Brush Truck shall be considered as a tool, or a resource. A Brush Truck is not staffed with a 4person crew and must be assigned to a Company Officer (or Sector Officer). Brush Trucks shall not
be assigned to positions on the fireground where they’re unsupervised and/or unsupported.
