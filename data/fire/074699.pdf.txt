Off-Duty/Out-of-Town Event
Should an incident occur while the member is off-duty or out of town/out of state, the
Appropriate Deputy Chief will immediately be notified.
The Appropriate Deputy Chief will assume the initial Welfare Sector responsibilities or assign
these responsibilities to another Chief Officer. Duties will include:
•
•
•
•
•

Notify the Fire Chief and Senior Staff.
Notify the Good and Welfare Officer.
Assign a Family Liaison Officer.
Assign a Hospital Liaison Officer (for Phoenix metro area hospitals).
Implement the appropriate items listed in this procedure.

For events out of the Phoenix metro area, or out of state, it may be necessary to contact the
Local Fire Department, as well as the Local Firefighters Union, to serve as the initial Hospital
Liaison Officer and to provide other assistance.
Fire Department Member Responsibilities
Fire department members and co-workers will be highly concerned in these incidents.
Members must understand that the Welfare Sector is designed to provide rapid, and accurate,
support to the family. It is important that members not “freelance” and take self-initiated
action. This kind of action in the past has often resulted in inaccurate information delivered to
the family member, or the family transported to the wrong hospital. This only increases the
emotional stress for the family.
Those members desiring to help should contact the Welfare Sector Officer. The system is
designed to absorb the assistance to, as well as, provide the maximum support to family
members.
Transfer of Welfare Sector Duties
During escalating serious incidents, the Welfare Sector responsibilities may be transferred to
the Assistant Chief of Personnel Division, or a designee. At some point, the “crisis” management
part of the Welfare Sector will stabilize. At this stage, duties may be transferred to the Welfare
Officer at the Health Clinic for ongoing monitoring and support.
