C99 is a response apparatus housed at Fire Prevention within the Phoenix Fire Department. It is staffed
by Deputy Fire Marshals that rotate on an A-B-C schedule to compliment the Fire Operations schedule.
C99 assists Fire Operations crews by remaining on scene of certain incidents in order to allow the crews
to return to service. C99 then contacts the property owners and responsible parties in order to coordinate
a resolution to the incident and legally transfer liability and risk back to the property owner or responsible
party through documentation. C99 is typically only dispatched at the discretion of the Company or
Command Officer managing the incident. Incidents that C99 can respond to are as follows:
SPRINKLER/ SUPPRESSION/ FIRE ALARM/ KITCHEN HOOD ANSUL / CO2 ACTIVATIONS OR
DAMAGE TO THESE SYSTEMS RENDERING THEM INOPERABLE
• Verify these systems have required life safety features and are installed correctly while operating
as designed
• Damaged systems require immediate restoration by licensed fire protection professional.
Systems that are unable to be restored to normal operating conditions will be documented and a
fire watch will be required
• Frequent false alarms or malfunctions, when reported by Fire Operations, will be followed up and
documented for correction
• Any CO2 alarm activation requires a C99 response. A false alarm or any leak will require an
inspection of the entire system

STRUCTUAL INTEGRITY ISSUES
