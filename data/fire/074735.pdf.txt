RESPONSIBILITY
The determination of fire origin and cause is necessary for all fire incidents. The Officer in
Charge is responsible for determining when a Fire Investigator is needed. This determination is
dependent on the information gathered at the scene and/or circumstances of the fire. The onduty Fire Investigators are available through Dispatch and Deployment or by phone to consult
with Command prior to or during response to assist Command.
A fire investigation is conducted after fire control and salvage activities are completed, but
before overhaul actions, which could hinder the investigation.
DISPATCH
A Fire Investigator dispatched by Dispatch and Deployment or called by the Officer in Charge,
will respond to the scene reference the following circumstances:
•

Fire deaths or serious fire injuries

•

All working first alarm or greater structure fires

•

Fires for which the cause cannot be determined by Command on the scene

•

Explosions and bombings

•

Requested by Phoenix Police Department to respond to known arson fires

•

Car, field, or dumpster fires that have an identified lead or suspect in custody

•

Attempted arsons

NON-DISPATCH
A Fire Investigator is not needed for the following situations. The company officer is responsible
for completing an accurate Field Incident Report to document the fire cause:
•

Minor fires where cause is determined to be accidental

•

Scalding burns, electrical accidents, and minor accidental burn injuries

•

Car fires originating in the engine area during vehicle operation, abandoned autos, or
vehicle arsons with no identified suspects

•

Minor grass, fence, or trash fires with no witnesses or suspects

•

Traffic accident fatalities involving fire subsequent to collision (investigated by Phoenix
Police Department)

•

To hold the scene until another agency or service responds

If an incident is determined to be of a minor nature (e.g. accidental, no injuries, slight fire
damage) and the cause can be determined by the Company Officer on scene through the
information gathered at the scene and/or circumstances of the fire, units on the scene shall
gather the information needed and to accurately complete the required report. If a victim
requests information regarding their fire loss, the Company Officer can give the Fire Department
Incident Number to assist the victim to accessing Fire Department information through the
Custodian of Records at 602-256-3395. The victim should also be given a copy of the P.F.D.
"After the Fire" brochure to assist them.
FIRE SCENE COORDINATION
When a Fire Investigator is on the scene or responding, companies will delay non-essential
overhaul and secure the fire scene until the Fire Investigator arrives. Salvage and all
unnecessary interim activities which may alter, contaminate the fire scene, or interfere with a
subsequent origin and cause investigation must be discontinued until authorized to continue by
the responding Fire Investigator.
Command will assign personnel to protect and maintain custody of the fire scene until the arrival
of a Fire Investigator, especially when a delay in response has been indicated by the
responding Fire Investigator.
After achieving fire control, Command may release companies not required for the completion of
the investigation and/or overhaul. In some cases, involving lengthy investigations, companies
may return to quarters and later respond back to the scene to complete overhaul activities when
requested by the Fire Investigations Sector.
Command will turn over jurisdiction of the fire area to the Fire Investigator as soon as possible
after the fire is stabilized. The Investigator retains jurisdiction of the scene until it is released
back to Command. The Fire Investigator may inform Command they need to maintain custody
of the scene for further investigation.
The Investigator will request from Command any personnel or equipment necessary for the
investigation. Command will make every attempt to meet such requests, to the extent possible
under the prevailing circumstances.
All personnel will cooperate with the Fire Investigator and the Fire Investigations Sector.
Protection of the fire scene and preservation of physical evidence is a primary concern once life
safety and fire control are achieved.
An attempt to identify the victims and witnesses at the fire scene will be made as soon as
possible, and will not be delayed until the Fire Investigator is on the scene. Obtaining the
identification of victims and witnesses is critical to the investigative process.

PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE
Every fire scene contains evidence. Fire fighting operations present the greatest potential for
damage to evidence which may be used by the Fire Investigators and the Police Department in
subsequent court cases and prosecution.
Evidence of fire cause is rarely destroyed by fire. The form, shape, color, size, and weight of
items may be altered, but evidence can still be identified upon trained examination. It is
imperative to preserve evidence as found, in place and not moving fire debris unnecessarily.
It is the responsibility of the Fire Department to protect the fire scene from unnecessary damage
during fire fighting operations. Special care exercised during extinguishment will avoid the
destruction of evidence through the misuse of fire streams. Salvage operations should be
minimal until the initial fire investigation is completed, and should be confined to diminishing
loss. Companies assigned to Loss Control Sector should incorporate scene security and
evidence preservation into their plan to stop the loss.
The fire scene is the Fire Investigator's laboratory. It is searched carefully and thoroughly,
photographed, diagrammed for placement of contents and evidence, and evidence is then
collected and preserved.
The fire scene must be secured. Evidence cannot be used in court unless the Fire Investigator
can establish a chain of custody by proving who found the evidence, where it was found and the
evidence was not tampered with while in official custody. To ensure that the chain of custody
remains unbroken, the scene must remain in the sole custody of the Fire Department. When at
a fire scene where custody must be maintained, a guard must be posted, and custody must be
maintained until the scene is released. No unauthorized persons may enter the scene. The Fire
Department has the legal authority to close the scene entirely, even to the property owner or to
other interested person/s. It is vital that the Fire Department prevent personnel from
unnecessarily walking through a fire area, walking on, obscuring evidence, or picking up and
moving evidence. This includes both Fire Department personnel and the media. If it is essential
that evidence be moved or if necessary fire fighting operations may damage evidence, the
evidence must be covered or its location marked before moving it carefully to a secure location.
ACCELERANT DETECTION CANINE
The Phoenix Fire Department Investigations Section has the services of an accelerant detection
canine assigned to the unit. The canine is used by the assigned Fire Investigator/Handler to
identify the use of accelerants in the ignition of the fire. Personnel should avoid contact with the
dog unless given permission by the dog handler.
The canine will be called by the on-duty Fire Investigator, as needed.
