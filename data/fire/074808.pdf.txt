Purpose
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the features and proper use of portable radios.
The best means of communication at an emergency scene is face-to-face. Face-to-face
communication should be utilized whenever possible within the company or sector.
Portable radios will be used whenever distance or circumstances prevent face-to-face
communication. Radio transmissions should be prioritized and concise.
Radio Familiarization
It is critical to be familiar with the operation and position of all portable radio capabilities and
controls. This familiarity will allow personnel to operate their radio in zero visibility.
Current portable radio equipment is the Motorola APX7000XE. The front of the radio houses
both the speaker and microphone to receive and transmit messages. An additional microphone
is located on the back of the radio. The rear microphone is used primarily by the radio software
to reduce background noise in the radio transmissions, however, if the front microphone fails,
the rear microphone can be used to transmit.
The top of the radio has many of the radio controls. The removable antenna is located on the
top right.
APX radios have multiple channel capabilities. The Hazard Deck "A”: (Fire Channels) 1 through
16. The Non-Hazard Deck “K” (Trunked Channels) 1 through 16. The Phoenix Police channels are
also located in the radio programming, amongst additional channels that allow seamless
interoperability with many outside agencies when needed.
The channel selector knob is located immediately next to the antenna. Turning the channel
selector switch clockwise enables the user to access channels 1 through 16. Channel 16 on both
the “A” and “K” decks are programmed with the same information as the Channel 1 position on
the respective deck. A1 and A16 are both programmed as Fire Channel 1. K1 and K16 are both
programmed as Fire “K” Deck 1. In the event you are unable to determine what channel you are
operating on, completely spinning the dial either direction will place you on Channel 1 where a
dispatcher is always staffed.
A small black toggle switch at the base of the channel selector knob will lock or unlock the
programmed buttons. When the switch is to the right in the lock position, you will not be able
to use any of the side buttons with the exception of the Push-To Talk (PTT) button.

The flat selector switch or toggle switch adjacent to the channel selection knob allows the user
to switch between hazard deck (RED) "A,” the non-hazard deck (YELLOW) "K,” and the Phoenix
Police (BLUE) “A” deck patrol channels.
The on/off/volume selector switch is the second knob from the antenna. The knob will turn the
radio on or off and control the radio volume. Turning this knob clockwise turns the radio on and
increases radio volume.
Between the antenna and the channel selector knob is the orange emergency traffic button.
Depressing this button sends an emergency traffic signal to the dispatch center identifying the
unit ID of the portable radio. Dispatch will contact the unit to verify/confirm emergency traffic
transmission.
The left side of the radio (as the user faces the speaker) has several buttons; the top button
(purple) is the backlight button. Depressing this button will illuminate the screen to display the
current channel. The long vertical button is the push-to-talk (PTT). This button must be
depressed to transmit radio messages. The radio cannot receive messages while this button is
depressed. Below the PTT button are the channel zone up and channel zone down buttons.
Depressing these buttons will cycle the zone of channels that the radio is on. When you reach
the desired zone, release the button and the zone will lock to that selected zone. Then you can
change to the correct channel as needed.
Turning the radio off and then on again will reset the radio to the zone that is selected on the
top of the radio on the multi-colored sticker. Simply change that selector to the correct default
zone that you wish to be on.
The right side of the radio is equipped with contacts for a remote mic (RSM). The recognized
best practice is to place the radio in your turnout coat pocket and use an RSM remote mic
clipped to your turnout coat to protect the radio from the environment whenever possible
The battery can be removed by pressing the release tabs on both the left and right side of the
battery.
Radio Operation
All operations members will have a portable radio assigned for their use. Each member will be
responsible for the security, proper use and maintenance of their radio. All radios should be
checked for proper operation at the beginning of each shift/whenever necessary. Radios not
functioning properly should be red tagged and the PFD Service Desk (602-261-8030 Option 1)

should be notified. Any radios unaccounted for must be reported immediately with a Police
Report and LSD form completed before a replacement can be issued.
Each member is responsible to carry their assigned radio on all emergency incidents. At other
times the radio will be carried at their discretion or secured in the fire vehicle.
The Captain or designee should ensure that each member is rostered into the MCT and
attached to the proper radio positon. Each apparatus has assigned radios and positions that are
coded into the CAD dispatch system for safety and accountability. It is important that when a
member is using a radio, they are using the radio they have been assigned in the MCT roster.
Battery status should be checked on a daily basis. A flashing green/yellow light on the vehicle
charger indicates that the batteries need reconditioning and the battery should be exchanged
with a fully charged battery from the station charger, and the old battery placed into the
station charger for reconditioning.
The use of the order model is required when transmitting or receiving messages.
Portable radio identification is as follows:
•
•
•
•

Engine 1 or Ladder 1 will apply to the Captain of the Fire Company.
Pump 1 or Truck 1 will apply to the Driver of the Fire Company.
The remaining personnel will go by their Fire Company ID and their name.
o Example: Engine 1 -- Firefighter Jones to Command
Single person vehicles will use their assigned vehicle ID
