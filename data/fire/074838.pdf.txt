Response actions at a Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) incident can be divided into those
undertaken by operational responders and those undertaken or supervised by hazmat
technicians. Medical management includes decontamination, triage, treatment, behavioral
health and transportation. The specific WMD agent involved -- chemical, biological or
radiological -- has an impact on scene management. All WMD terrorism incidents are crime
scenes; police sector needs early establishment. Additional detail for WMD response
operations may be found in Phoenix Fire Department WMD Field Operations Guide (FOG).
FIRST ARRIVING UNITS
The first arriving officer will establish Command and begin a size-up. Survey visible activity,
signs and symptoms. Notice potential effects of wind, topography and location of the incident.
Route other responding companies away from visible hazards.
Command will establish level II staging whenever possible. Care must be taken to establish
staging in a safe area, taking into account the characteristics of the likely WMD agent (chemical,
biological, radiological).
Area Isolation/ Perimeter Establishment
I.

Command Size-up gathers information for incident management plan
•
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•

In known or suspected explosions when purposeful or terrorist activity cannot be ruled
out (i.e., natural gas explosion) initial actions should be to secure a hot zone perimeter
and call for the EOD (PD bomb squad) to respond.
Entry into the hot zone/crime scene should be under the direction of unified Command
with Haz Mat – radiological monitoring, Tech Rescue – secondary collapse, and EOD
secondary explosive devices/crime scene, issues being addressed.
If victims are present the Incident Commander should establish communication quickly
to control their anxiety and behavior. Select a fire member/officer (preferably paramedic)
as a point of communication to establish rapport and credibility. If possible all direct
communications to victims should be conducted/coordinated through this person.
A WMD/terrorist incident is a CRIME SCENE. Once fire/hazmat work is complete,
scene passes to FBI.
Remember any signs of WMD devices, dispersion apparatus, or other potential
evidence.
BE AWARE OF SECONDARY DEVICES designed to injure additional victims and/or first
responders. Upon sighting a device that appears operable, withdraw personnel until
Police Bomb Squad has inspected/rendered safe any suspicious appearing device.
Remember locations of potential evidence; do not move or collect it yourself.
Pay attention to symptoms exhibited by victims for relay to hazmat/paramedic personnel.
Prepare to Evacuate nearby area if indicated by wind, explosive or similar danger.

If fire is present and radiological agent suspected, evacuate to 2000 feet. Check
downwind areas for contamination.
IN THE CASE OF LETTER OR PACKAGE CONTAINING UNKNOWN SUBSTANCE:
¾ Quarantine persons in the immediate area of exposure (office or room) and
place them in a safe refuge area.
¾ Isolate the area that the substance or package is located; hold for Hazmat
Team to double bag and secure.
¾ Control Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems by shutting down to
prevent spread of contamination.
DO NOT USE SPECIFIC NAME OF SUSPECTED AGENT OVER THE
RADIO; USE ONLY ABIOLOGICAL AGENT@ OR AUNKNOWN AGENT@.
If a biological agent is contained in a single room or office in a multi-function
building, the building should be evacuated.

II. IF NO APPARENT VICTIMS, LIFE HAZARD, RESCUE SITUATION, OR FIRE EXIST, FIRE
DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL SHOULD NOT BE EXPOSED TO RISK.
First arriving units should secure a perimeter, evaluate the situation, and
await the arrival of the Hazardous Materials Technicians.
•

USE AVAILABLE PPE TO MINIMIZE SAFETY RISKS FOR OPERATIONAL
RESPONDERS.
Minimize entry of first responders into HOT ZONE.
Minimum PPE is turnouts, butyl rubber gloves and SCBA.

III. Establish Zones of Limited Access.
•

•

The HOT ZONE is the area immediately around the site/munition/device/source.
Enforce a single entry control point. All personnel entering this area must wear full
protective gear. The entry control point should be a minimum of 300 feet from the
source. This applies whether suspected agent is chemical, biological or radiological.
The WARM ZONE is upwind and uphill from the Hot Zone for Chemical and Radiological
Threats. Biological agents are non-volatile and controllable: if contained in a building
little downwind threat is posed; if release point is in the open, downwind hazard may
exist.

Page 3 of 14

Hot Zone Support, Rescue, and Technical Decon personnel operate in WARM ZONE
with full protective gear. Decon lines are established in the WARM ZONE. This area
should be minimally 15 feet wide, but must encompass all victims awaiting decon and
decon equipment. A LOBBY SECTOR will be established at the entry to the warm zone
for accountability.
•

The COLD ZONE is outside the Warm Zone. For Chemical and Radiological agents,
COLD ZONE is uphill and upwind from Warm Zone. No contaminated personnel or
equipment should pass into the COLD ZONE. Incident Command, medical and
transportation are located in the COLD ZONE. Personnel should keep protective gear at
hand in case of wind shift or accidental contamination.

IV. COORDINATE WITH POLICE TO ESTABLISH SECURITY FOR SITE
•
•
•
•

Police will secure scene to insure safety for victims and emergency responders.
Police will search immediate area for presence of secondary devices.
If potentially explosive devices are sighted or suspected, Police Special Assignments
Unit will investigate and clear. Fire personnel will withdraw to safe staging area until
safe re-entry is possible. Fire personnel will NOT move or disarm suspected devices.
Victims and others will be denied entry and exit from HOT ZONE. Police will enforce
these restrictions. Fire personnel will NOT use physical force to restrain public.

Equipment Positioning
Position equipment upwind, uphill and upstream from the incident site. If the incident is indoors,
insure any ventilation exhaust ports are not blowing vapors into the established response areas.
Shut down HVAC systems to minimize contamination spread.
Assess Downwind Hazards
Be aware of the presence of, or potential for downwind, plumes. This threat exists for chemical,
biological and radiological [particles] agents. If a downwind hazard exists, initiate appropriate
action (evacuation or shelter-in-place) for those at risk. Adjust incident perimeters to account
for windage risks.
Gather Casualties/Initiate Victim Management
I.

Immediately begin process of gathering ambulatory victims.
•
•
•

Using an amplified PA system, direct victims to an established holding area to await
evaluation and emergency gross decontamination.
If deaths occur during sorting, redefine HOT ZONE perimeter to include bodies.
Explain emergency decontamination to victims.

Page 4 of 14

Once emergency decon is complete, sort ambulatory victims into:
¾ People with Special Needs
¾ Gender groups

•

Continue to process any additional victims who exit the impact area.

II. USE CAUTION [PPE] WHEN CONTACTING VICTIMS
•
•
•

Those exposed to CHEMICAL agents may be off-gassing.
BIOLOGICAL victims may be contaminated with particles or droplets of agent.
RADIOLOGICAL victims pose no danger; particles on skin or clothing brush or wash off.

III. NOTE LOCATIONS OF DEAD AT SCENE
•
•

HOT ZONE perimeter should be defined to include all dead bodies.
Unless absolutely necessary do not move bodies.

IV. NON-AMBULATORY VICTIMS SHOULD LIE IN PLACE
•
•

If necessary administer emergency medical measures WHILE WEARING PPE.
If external threat (building collapse, etc.) threatens, move victim(s) to safe area.

V. NOTE VICTIMS IN NEED OF RESCUE. Do not undertake rescue without PPE
VI. DEAD ANIMALS AND BIRDS AT THE SCENE
Deceased animals and birds at the scene will be handled as deceased people are handled,
expanding the Hot Zone to include their locations. Once scene operations have concluded,
Maricopa County Animal Control (MCAC) will be notified of the presence of deceased and
contaminated animals.
Emergency Decontamination
I.

Emergency decontamination for chemical agents should begin as soon as possible.
•

Emergency Decon serves three functions:
¾ Marks victims for easy identification
¾ Removes product/particles from victims
¾ Engages victims in activity that reduces anxiety.

Page 5 of 14

Using PA system/bull horn, instruct victims on procedure:
¾ spread arms and legs wide; turn slowly so all parts of body are rinsed; clothing is
NOT removed for emergency decon unless patient was exposed to a liquid splash.
¾ Victims will be thoroughly wet using a booster line. Soak victims from top of head
downward with copious amounts of water.

•

In an event with multiple victims, which may inundate the booster line procedure of
emergency decontamination, a master stream(s) creating a dense shower flow should
be established as a more effective method of mass casualty emergency
decontamination.

II. Minimum PPE for decontaminating victims is turnouts and SCBA.
III. Locate Emergency Decon corridor Upgrade from HOT ZONE if possible. Notice direction
and impact of uncontrolled runoff for referral to clean-up.
Note: Emergency decontamination is not necessary for biological and radiological
contamination. ONLY victims who have other medical injuries that require immediate
medical attention should be prioritized and decontaminated as necessary.
HAZMAT UNITS
Hazmat Sector Establishment, Site Assessment
I. Command -- through Hazmat -- will make site assessment to:
•
•
•
•

assign levels of PPE;
confirm/adjust hot/warm/cold zones and incident perimeter; For Radiological Agent, HOT
ZONE is defined as area where survey instruments produce readings of 2 MR/hour and
higher;
confirm/adjust equipment placement.
reassess downwind hazards; implement evacuation/shelter-in-place as needed.

II. Operations personnel become support.
III. Hazmat brings necessary pharmaceuticals/antidotes to the scene.
Hazmat Initiates Technical Decon Set-up/Operation
I. WMD Technical Decon Lines for personnel and equipment described in MP 204.14C?
II. If available and time permits, Female Decon Team Assists with set-up then operates
female/special needs line.

III. Three shelters will be assembled: Two Ambulatory and a Special Needs/Non Ambulatory
decontamination shelter for victims requiring assistance, staffed by a male and female
support group.
•
•
•
•
•

Each decontamination shelter will be staffed with a minimum of 5 personnel (for mass
casualty incidents) processing victims through the various stations.
A Separate Technician Decon operation should be set up for response personnel away
from the victim decon lines.
Non-ambulatory and Special Needs Victims will be processed through decon lines with
assistance rendered as necessary by station attendants.
Decon of Deceased takes place AFTER ambulatory and non-ambulatory victims are
deconned, treated and transported.
If Federal response is not available, deceased victims may be decontaminated by Fire
Department personnel trained in stripping and decontamination of bodies before the
Maricopa County Medical Examiner’s Office assumes control of the body. Victims
who expire after decontamination (in the cold zone) will be held for the County Medical
Examiner’s Office.

Hazmat: Initial Entry
I.

Initial entry into the Hot Zone will be made by Hazmat Technicians.
•
•
•

For Chemical agents level A protection is worn. All personnel entering the Hot Zone will
carry THREE Nerve Agent Antidote Kits (MARK I) for self administration as needed.
For Biological agents, the level of protection is worn, as assigned by IC consulting with
HazMat and toxicologists/poison control.
For Radiological threats, minimum PPE is turnouts, butyl rubber gloves and SCBA;
XETEX dosimeters will be worn by all entering Hot Zone.

II. Two entry teams and appropriate backup teams will be established. One entry team will be
assigned to victim rescue and extrication. The second entry team will address agent
identification.
III. When victims are trapped, extrication, high angle rescue, trench rescue, or other technical
rescue may be used.
•
•

Extrication is conducted by the Extrication Sector of the Medical Branch, assisted by
other PFD special units. If special equipment or skills are demanded to achieve rescue,
PFD Technical Rescue Teams (TRT) will be used.
Non-ambulatory, but not trapped, victims located in the Hot or Warm Zones will be
handled only by personnel in appropriate PPE. Hot zone rescues only by Hazmat.

Hazmat: Agent Identification
I. All Chemical incidents will be treated as a Hazmat situation. The standard chemical
detection and air monitoring devices (i.e., HAZCAT) will be used during a response. If the
incident is suspected or confirmed to involve unconventional warfare chemicals, the
following list of detection devices (in conjunction with the standard equipment) will be used
for agent identification:
M-8 Chemical Detection Paper - chemical liquids
M-9 Chemical Detection Paper - chemical liquids
Dragger Colormetric Tubes - chemical vapors
M256 Chemical Detection Kit - chemical liquids and vapors
APD-2000 CW Detector - chemical vapors
In all cases where a chemical WMD is suspected, every available chemical detection device
will be used for secondary and tertiary confirmation of suspected chemicals.
II. For Biological incidents sampling is necessary and scene assessments will be undertaken
if equipment is available.
•

•
•

Hazmat teams will collect and test samples of any suspected Biological agent with the
appropriate field detection kit. Phoenix PD will transfer the sample to the Arizona
Department of Health Services (ADHS) State Laboratory for further testing and
identification.
Toxicology support is available at the scene and/or in the EOC through the Samaritan
Regional Poison Control Center.
Phoenix Police Department personnel will transport suspected biological agent samples
to the ADHS State Laboratory.

III. For Radiological incidents, Victoreen Instrument CDU-700 and Ludlum Model IIC
Radiacmeters will be used to identify the source of contamination and designate zones of
operation (Hot, Warm and Cold). The same instruments will be used to monitor personnel.
The Arizona Radiation Regulatory Agency (ARRA) will be notified to deploy teams to assist
with defining the extent of contamination.
Hazmat: Safety and Secondary Devices
I. Beginning with first at scene, all personnel will be cognizant of bombs and secondary
devices in their areas of operation. No PFD personnel should ever inspect or move a
suspected secondary device.

II. If operational personnel locate a suspected secondary device, the Hot Zone will be
expanded to include the device. All Fire personnel will withdraw from the area. Police
Bomb Technicians will enter the area to render the device safe. Once safety has been
established, PFD will resume operations.
III. If a secondary device is discovered by Hazmat technicians as they make entry into the Hot
Zone, they will withdraw from the area. PD bomb technicians will enter the area with PPE to
render the device safe. Fire operations will resume after safety has been established.
IV. The Phoenix PD bomb technicians will operate with two teams. The first team is an Entry
(Render Safe) Team. The second team is back-up to the Entry Team. If the threat is large
enough to demand the use of two PD entry teams, PFD Hazmat personnel, if available, will
provide a back-up rescue team to support PD operations in the Hot Zone.
MEDICAL MANAGEMENT
I. Whether the agent is chemical, biological or radiological, victims of a Weapons of Mass
Destruction/terrorist incident may present injuries caused by explosions, fire, falls, or other
mechanisms not directly related to the hazard agent itself. These can include cardiac
symptoms. As appropriate, treatment of such injuries should be initiated in the field.
II. For victims in a chemical incident, treatment protocols will follow established agent specific
guidelines. For nerve agents (sarin, soman, VX) Mark I Kits are used for adults; atropine
injections for pediatric. Oxygen is administered for choking agents. Amyl Nitrate (or sodium
nitrite or sodium thiosulfate) is given for Blood agents. Blister agents are given supportive
therapy for blisters plus pain medication.
III. For biological agent victims, it is possible that no symptoms may be present. If an agent is
positively identified, patients will be decontaminated and moved to hospitals or other
shelters for quarantine or observation.
IV. Victims of a radiological agent are unlikely to exhibit specific symptoms at the scene.
Exposure to ionizing radiation produces tissue and cell changes that are slow onset.
Radioactive particles are easily removed from skin and clothing. RADIATION EXPOSURE
ALONE IS NOT A MEDICAL EMERGENCY.
V. Treatment and triage are responsibilities of the IMS Medical Sector/Branch with information
from Hazmat. Extrication from the Hot Zone and decontamination is part of the Hazmat
Sector/Branch. In a small incident, Transportation may be a sector under the Medical
Branch; with a large number of victims.
VI. Command will assess scene stability and determine whether medical sector/branch is
located at the scene or away from the scene.

Triage
I.

The objective of triage is to sort victims so that the maximum number of lives may be
preserved through rapid and effective use of medical therapeutics.
•

S.T.A.R.T. (Simple Triage And Rapid Treatment) criteria will be used for triage, using
four classifications:
IMMEDIATE: requiring immediate treatment for survival;
DELAYED: not likely to be adversely affected by delay in treatment or movement to
definitive care;
MINOR: ambulatory and able to follow simple commands, may or may not require minor
treatment;
DEAD OR DYING.

II. The Arizona S.T.A.R.T. triage tag will be used for all patients. The tag shows patient
classification and also identifies injuries and treatments administered in the field, and
becomes the tracking base for patients.
•
•

In the event of a very large number of victims, triage may be indicated initially by
marking the priority on the patient’s forehead with the felt pen. In such cases, the triage
tag will be attached as soon as feasible.
Triage tag numbers are used for patient tracking; the triage tag becomes part of the
patient record after arrival at hospital. Triage tags remain attached to patients
transferred from the scene to the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) for forward
movement.

Treatment
I. Treatment areas will be established in the cold zone.
II. Medical treatment will address supportive needs of patients. Care for injuries (sustained in
explosions, fires, falls or other events related to the incident) collateral to WMD agent
exposure will be administered. Particular attention is reserved for airway/respiratory and
cardiovascular support. For all agents, patients will have experienced a terrorist event
demands attention be given to Behavioral Health issues.
Treatments administered at the scene will be guided by agent identification and medical
advise from toxicology/poison control personnel.
•

For chemical exposures, if agent is identified antidotes may be initially administered
during decon and continued in treatment area. Antidote choice and dose are agent
specific.

For biological agents, antibiotic or antitoxin administration may initiated after
decontamination as directed by toxicology/poison control.
For radiation exposures, symptomatic support is offered [no antidotes or efficacious
treatments exist].

III. For otherwise uninjured patients exposed to biological agents, if victim is nonsymptomatic, treatment may be confined to observation or initiation of antibiotics/antitoxins.
Command will determine if patients that are to be observed are transported to hospitals or to
shelters. Patients receiving initial antibiotic doses may be directed (by Command) to obtain
further antibiotics from public health authorities, from hospitals, or from private physicians.
Treatment Sector Officer may refer patients to Behavioral Health personnel and/or Police
Sector for interview.
IV. For otherwise uninjured, not contaminated and non-symptomatic patients exposed to
radiological agents, Treatment Sector Officer will review and
a. direct to treatment by a private physician;
b. refer to Police Sector for interview; and/or
c. refer to Behavioral Health personnel for interview.

V. For victims of chemical agents, exposed patients whether currently symptomatic or notrequire observation. Symptomatic patients require antidotes and supportive therapy. Nonsymptomatic patients, particularly those exposed to nerve or blister agents, may become
symptomatic within hours. Patients who can be confirmed as not exposed may be referred
by Treatment Sector Officer to Behavioral Health personnel and/or Police Sector for
interview.
VI. PHARMACEUTICALS will be brought to the incident scene with the responding Hazmat
teams or tox medic units. Additional Pharmaceuticals and equipment will be transported to
scene as needed.
VII. Specific treatment protocols for WMD agents are described in M.P. 201.14D.

Behavioral Health
I. Behavioral Health needs of victims will be addressed by Community Assistance Program
(Alternate Response) units (with call-up from TERROS, EMPACT and American Red Cross
as needed).
•

The mission of these personnel is to attend to the crisis mental health needs of victims
and responders, thereby assuring smooth operation and continuous flow of patients
through decontamination, treatment and transportation.

II. On scene, Behavioral Health Units may be assigned (in appropriate PPE) to
decontamination lines, in the treatment areas, and at the Transportation Sector to perform
their behavioral health functions.
III. Behavioral Health Units and personnel will be deployed to receiving hospitals to support
hospital behavioral health professionals in caring for short-term victim needs, including
debriefings. If mass shelters are established for victims, Behavioral Health personnel will
provide similar services at those locations. During the incident, Behavioral Health personnel
will be available to address short-term crisis needs of victim family members.
Transportation
I. The Transportation Sector/Branch moves patients from the scene to receiving hospitals or to
shelters as assigned by Command.
•
•

Only patients who have been decontaminated will be transported.
Zones will be designated in or near treatment areas to serve as collection points for
patients to be transported.

II. Ambulatory victims, once given initial assessment, decontamination and treatment, can be
transported en mass on designated vehicles (busses and other multiple patient transports).
Patients whose condition merits will be transported to medical facilities via ambulance. If
appropriate and such transport will not further disperse the agent, air transportation may be
used.
III. Decontaminated, uninjured patients may be released or transferred to mass shelter
locations as determined to be appropriate by Command. Names and contact information
will be recorded for all released individuals for any necessary post-incident follow-up as well
as behavioral health interviews.
IV. Some civilians present at the scene may not have experienced injury or exposure to a
chemical agent, and may not require decon. Witnesses may fall into this category. After
medical review, Command may direct such people to be documented and interviewed by
Police Sector. Behavioral Health personnel may also interview such victims to offer
assistance.
V.

Movement and loading of vehicles at the scene will be managed by Transportation
Sector/Branch, with security/support from the Police Department as appropriate. Acquisition
of additional vehicles and equipment will be handled through the Resource Sector/Branch.

VI. If the local hospital system is overwhelmed early in an incident, or treatment requires it,
patients may be moved to the NDMS Patient Reception Center (PRC). Patients will not be
transported from the scene until the Transportation Officer has confirmed that the PRC is
operational. The chain of treatment will be continued at the PRC until patients are placed on
aircraft. Patients transferred to NDMS will be tracked through their triage tags.
Hospitals
I.

Potential receiving hospitals will be notified immediately by dispatch (EMSystem and
MCMAS) upon determination that a WMD agent is involved in an incident.

II.

Receiving hospitals will engage lock-down status.

III. Hospitals will receive information on the probable (or identified) agent, decontamination
guidance, and recommendations on patient care from toxicology/poison control personnel
based in the City EOC. The priority will be to disseminate this information to receiving
hospitals first, and then to all area hospitals. Once established MCMAS and EMSystem will
enable simultaneous communication to all hospitals.
IV. Medical Branch will coordinate with the pharmaceuticals representative in the EOC , and
deliver appropriate drugs, antidotes and equipment (as adjuncts to those maintained at
hospitals) to receiving hospitals.
V.

Hospitals will assume responsibility for decontamination, triage and treatment of “walk in”
patients. This includes primary set-up of decontamination and maintenance of PPE for
hospital personnel. A PFD unit (with appropriate PPE) trained in decontamination set up
and procedures may be dispatched as scene demands de-escalate to each receiving
hospital to assist in decontamination of walk-ins. Hospitals will handle medical triage for
walk-ins and assume tracking responsibility for patients not processed through the scene.

VI. The Phoenix Police Department will dispatch units with appropriate PPE as necessary to
assist hospital security personnel in maintaining order at receiving facilities. This includes
isolation and management of self-referrals awaiting decontamination.
VII. Medical staff at receiving hospitals will determine patient treatment needs and the nature of
definitive care. A medical decision may be made to refer the patient to the NDMS for
transportation to definitive care. In this event, hospital transportation, supported as
appropriate by Fire Department ambulances, will be arranged to transfer the patient(s) to
NDMS at Sky Harbor International Airport. Hospital patients being moved who require
continuing care and/or treatment between the time of hospital departure and the time they
can be loaded on aircraft will obtain that treatment in the Patient Reception Center (PRC).

VIII. Individual hospitals will determine their patient capacity and coordinate that information with
the EOC and Transportation Sector at the scene. When a hospital closes due to
maximum patient load, victims will be transported to other receiving hospitals. In the event
all area hospitals become saturated (and alternate treatment areas are either full or not
established), victims from the scene will be transported to the NDMS receiving area at Sky
Harbor International Airport.
RECOVERY/RESTORATION ACTIONS
The recovery and restoration phase begins after the last living patients have been transported
from the scene. During this phase, it is expected that Federal response elements will arrive with
specialized teams and equipment. Federal resources will support hazard monitoring,
technical (equipment) and environmental decontamination, and site restoration.
Technical Decon of Response Personnel/Equipment and Shutdown
I.

Hazmat personnel continue to perform and/or supervise the technical personnel decon
corridor.

II. Hazmat personnel will establish and operate an equipment decontamination corridor to
support restoration of equipment needed to re-establish essential services.
III. Hazmat personnel will shut down the emergency decon operation and technical decon
corridors as they complete operation.
IV. Hazmat personnel will find/document uncontained runoff problems from decon corridors.
V. Equipment and protocol for personnel and equipment decontamination are described in
M.P. 204.14C.
Site Survey
I. To the extent possible, Hazmat personnel will continue to monitor all equipment and areas
suspected to be contaminated with available detection and identification devices. Hazmat
will coordinate with Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) for additional
monitoring assistance outside of the hot/warm zones.
II. Hazmat personnel will document all runoff areas, apparatus and other locations suspected or
identified as contaminated.

III. When biological agents are involved, Hazmat teams will continue to collect samples of
suspected contamination for evaluation by ADHS State Laboratory. PD will transport
samples from scene to laboratory.
IV. In radiological incidents, Hazmat personnel will coordinate with Arizona Radiation
Regulatory Agency to establish that equipment and site have been successfully
decontaminated.
V. For chemical agents, areas and equipment that cannot be accommodated in the technical
equipment decon corridor will be cleaned with a 5% bleach solution. A minimum solution
contact time of 15 minutes will be observed, then area or equipment will be thoroughly
rinsed and remonitored for contamination. The process will continue until monitoring
indicates no contamination is present.
VI. Hazmat personnel will provide technical assistance/support as requested to Maricopa
County, State, and/or Federal agencies engaged in restoration operations. Such agencies
will be operating under the Federal Response Plan.
Hazmat assist in transfer of deceased to County Medical Examiner
I. Deceased are to be left in hot zone unit all victims have been transported.
II. Maricopa County Medical Examiner’s Office, supported by Federal D-Mort Teams, will
examine bodies for evidence prior to decon. Decon may be supported by PFD Hazmat
personnel as requested.
III. Tracking, transportation and storage of bodies and belongings will be handled by the
Medical Examiner’s Office to insure preservation of chain of evidence custody.
