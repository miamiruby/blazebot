It is the policy of the Phoenix Fire Department that all personnel expected to respond and function in
areas of atmospheric contamination, shall be equipped with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)
and trained in its proper use and maintenance.
Members shall achieve a NON-LEAKING facepiece-to-skin seal WITH THE MASK. Facial hair shall not
be allowed at points where the SCBA facepiece is designed to seal with the face. INDIVIDUAL
MEMBERS SHALL BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THIS REQUIREMENT.
Each member of the Operations Division shall be accountable for one SCBA and shall check the
condition of that SCBA at the beginning of each shift, after each use, and at any other time it may be
necessary to render the equipment in a ready state of condition. Each member shall be accountable
for their personal facepiece and regulator. Each member is also required to undergo a physical
examination annually if they are expected to respond and function in areas of atmospheric
contamination.
Company Officers shall assign a specific SCBA to each crew member. Each crew member will be
responsible for the proper use and function of that SCBA.
If a SCBA is found to be functioning improperly, it shall be taken out of service, red tagged, reported,
and replaced immediately. Replacement SCBAs shall be obtained from Resource Management or
from the on-duty RM50 Captain after normal business hours.
The intent of the SCBA policy is to avoid any respiratory contact with products of combustion, superheated gases, toxic products or other hazardous contaminants.
The use of breathing apparatus means that all personnel shall have facepieces in place, breathing air
from the supply provided. Where appropriate, Airline-Supplied Breathing Apparatus may be used in
place of SCBA.
SCBA SHALL BE USED BY ALL PERSONNEL OPERATING:
• IN A CONTAMINATED ATMOSPHERE
• IN AN ATMOSPHERE WHICH MAY SUDDENLY BECOME CONTAMINATED
• IN AN ATMOSPHERE WHICH IS OXYGEN DEFICIENT
• IN AN ATMOSPHERE WHICH IS SUSPECTED OF BEING CONTAMINATED OR OXYGEN
DEFICIENT
This includes all personnel operating:
• In an active fire area
• Directly above an active fire area
• In a potential explosion or fire area, including gas leaks and fuel spills

Where products of combustion are visible in the atmosphere, including vehicle fires and
dumpster fires
Where invisible contaminants and/or carcinogens are present, suspected to be present, or may
be released without warning
In any confined space which has not been tested to establish respiratory safety
Engineers or apparatus operators in a contaminated atmosphere or one that may become
contaminated

In addition to the above, SCBA shall be worn by all personnel operating at fire incidents above ground,
below ground or in any other area which is not, but which may become contaminated by products of
combustion or other hazardous substances. In these circumstances only, the SCBA may be worn with
the facepiece removed. The wearing of SCBA in these situations provides that it will be immediately
available for use if conditions change or if personnel are to enter an area where the use of SCBA is
required.
Premature removal of SCBA must be avoided at all times. This is particularly significant during
overhaul when smoldering materials produce increased quantities of toxic substances including
carcinogens. Firefighters should be mindful that exposure to products of combustion, such as smoke,
does not require visible conditions.
If there is any doubt about respiratory safety, SCBA use shall be maintained until the atmosphere is
established to be safe by testing. Hazard or Safety Sector personnel are typically responsible for this
determination. This is required in complex situations, particularly when toxic materials may be involved.
An evaluation of all members of the Operations Division in the use of the SCBA should be conducted
annually. Each member shall be able to demonstrate a high level of proficiency and compatibility with
the SCBA under conditions which simulate those expected as a job requirement. Each member shall
also demonstrate an effective facepiece to skin seal of the SCBA facepiece.
