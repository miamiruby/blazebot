PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish standard guidelines for conducting structural training fires
while complying with NFPA Standard 1403. All other Phoenix Regional procedures will also apply to
training fires where applicable.
The objective of a training fire is to provide realistic fire ground training under actual fire conditions for
recruit and uniformed firefighters while providing high levels of safety and minimizing risk to firefighters.
Training fires will be designed to minimize the risk and to control the fire conditions so that firefighters
are not unnecessarily exposed to hazards or injuries.
Training fires present the same hazards as those encountered at actual field incidents. The Incident
Command System employed at actual fire incidents will be Standard Operating Procedure at all
structural training fires. Refer to Volume II, Standard Operating Procedures.
PROCEDURES FOR ON OR OFF SITE BURNING
PERMITS
The Training Academy holds a burn permit issued by Maricopa County Environmental Services
Department. The officer in charge is responsible for complying with the conditions stated on the burn
permit. This includes burning only during the months and hours specified on the permit. Check the
burn permit located in the main office to verify that the permit is current and has not expired.
The officer in charge is also responsible for calling the Air Quality Division each morning of the day of
burning to obtain permission to burn that day. The phone number is (602) 506-6700. You must fill in
the log at the time of the phone call with your name, the person you spoke to, type of burn, and time of
day.
Note: Burns conducted outside the City of Phoenix boundaries may require local permits in addition to
the county permit. Check with local jurisdiction before burning.
All burns, (off-site and on-site) must be conducted in compliance with the Fire Department’s Burn
Permit issued by the Maricopa County Department of Environmental Services, Air Quality Division.
This includes limitations on the times when burns are allowed and pre-approval of all burns to ensure
that they do not contribute to violations of the air quality health standards. Burn permits conducted off
the training academy campus MAY require a burn permit specific to site/property where the burn is to
occur.
All structural off-site burns require an asbestos survey and filing a completed NESHAPs form with
Maricopa County Department of Environmental Services, Air Quality Division at least ten (10) working
days prior to the scheduled burn.

COMMAND
One officer on the scene shall be designated as "Command" and will assume the Command functions.
A Command Post shall be established and positioned to afford maximum visibility of the structure,
operating companies and fire conditions.
COMMUNICATIONS
Command is responsible for establishing radio communications with each company officer or training
officer involved in the drill. Channel assignment must be coordinated with Dispatch and Deployment
and all companies involved. Companies operating at the training fire will continuously monitor the
assigned radio channel. All radios will be checked for proper functioning and correct channel prior to
initiating training fire operations.
SECTORS
To eliminate confusion, and provide adequate scene control, all personnel operating within the
fireground perimeter shall operate under the direction of a sector officer. The fireground perimeter shall
be defined as the hazardous area surrounding the burn structure and shall be determined by Command
following guidelines stated in Fireground Safety.
The following sectors shall be established on all structural training fires.
Interior -

Company or training officer directing interior suppression activities.

Exposure -

Provide manned, charged hose line positioned to protect exposed property. More than
one hose line (and therefore, more than one sector) may be required, depending on the
exposures present.

Rescue (RIC)

Provide a manned, charged back-up line for each fire attack team, in position to
assist in fire extinguishment and rescue of interior personnel. This sector will be
manned by experienced firefighting personnel (not recruit firefighters) and each Rapid
Intervention Crew (RIC) shall consist of a minimum of three firefighters. A company
officer shall be in charge of each RIC unit. There shall be one rescue (RIC) team for
each fire attack team. The RIC will be positioned in a ready state near the exterior point
of entry.

Rehab -

All personnel not assigned to other sectors will be under the direction of Rehab. Rehab
area will be established in a location that reduces congestion around the fire building.

Safety -

The Safety Officer (or a safety representative) will be in attendance at all structural
training fires and will assume safety sector responsibilities. The safety sector will
monitor personnel and fire conditions, and work with Command to ensure all safety
procedures are complied with, and that risk to personnel is minimized.

Page 3 of 11

Other sectors may be established as necessary to control training/fire control
operations and to minimize risk to firefighters.

SAFETY
The Safety Officer shall have full authority to intervene and control or stop any aspect of the operations
when in his/her judgment; a potential or real risk to personnel exists. He/she will not be assigned other
duties that would distract from his/her safety responsibilities.
Additional Safety Officers may be assigned to the training fire if the conditions dictate. Responsibilities
of the Safety Officer(s) will include but not be limited to the prevention of unsafe acts and elimination of
unsafe conditions.
Company officers acting as instructors will be responsible for the direct supervision of assigned
students and their safety and welfare, including the prevention of unsafe acts and the elimination of
unsafe conditions.
Fire Department personnel will not be permitted to operate on the roof during active fire conditions in
the building.
The number of personnel involved in training fires often exceeds the number normally assigned at
actual incidents. To reduce risk, and assist with scene management, training fire participants shall be
formed into individual companies consisting of no more than four (4) members and supervised by a
company officer.
Exposing recruit firefighters to structural training fires presents special safety considerations. All sector
officers should anticipate that a recruit firefighter's exposure to interior fire conditions may be less than
orderly. To reduce the possibility of injury, the span of control for interior operations shall not exceed
two recruits for each company or training officer.
All firefighters involved in structural training fires shall have received training to meet the performance
objectives of Firefighter I, NFPA 1001 in:
• Forcible Entry
• Protective Breathing Apparatus
• Fire Hose, Nozzles and Appliances
• Fire Streams
• Ladders
• Ventilation
• Rescue
• Safety
• Fire Behavior
No personnel shall be permitted to act as a victim(s) during live training fires.

To reinforce safety procedures, a protective clothing and equipment inspection shall be conducted on
all firefighters immediately prior to and after engaging in suppression activities. The inspection shall
insure that all clothing and equipment is serviceable and worn in a manner to provide the maximum
personal protection.
The Safety Officer will be responsible for completing the safety checklist prior to initiating the training
exercise.
One officer on the scene shall be designated as an accountability officer and will assume the
accountability functions.
To enhance accountability and to improve tracking of firefighters in the Hot Zone, the "PASSPORT"
system shall be used,
Personnel Accountability Report or "PAR" shall be used at the following accountability benchmarks:
• Upon entering the structure
• Any report of a trapped or missing firefighter
• By all crews reporting an "All Clear"
• At a report of fire under control
• Upon exiting the structure
• Sudden hazardous event
• Change from offensive to defensive strategy
• At the discretion of Command
Passports will remain with the designated accountability officer near the "point of entry" to the Hot
Zone. Upon entry, crews will turn in their PASSPORT. Upon exit, the crew must retrieve their
PASSPORT. The accountability status board will contain only the PASSPORTS of those crews in the
Hot Zone.
Access to the training fire building will be controlled by fire line tape that shall be stretched around the
fire-building perimeter.
Personnel within this perimeter may be permitted to operate with the SCBA facepiece removed. All
other protective clothing items shall be in place.
All personnel not wearing appropriate protective clothing and equipment shall remain outside the fire
line perimeter.
REQUIRED FIRE EQUIPMENT AND COMPANIES
Two separate sources of hydrant water supply shall be established (two Engine Companies minimum).
The water supply shall be test flowed by the forward pumper to insure adequate water supply of a
minimum of 500 gallons per minute.

All fire attack hose lines shall be supplied by one pumper. The RIC unit backup hose lines shall be
supplied by a second pumper. All hose lines will be flow tested to confirm a minimum of 95 gpm.
An on-duty battalion chief or other chief officer designated by the Training Academy staff shall be on
scene to supervise the overall operation.
A utility truck and a rescue shall be on scene prior to the start of the training fire. An ALS company
shall also be on scene.
Access to the scene shall be controlled to permit emergency access to and from the site.
All apparatus will be appropriately placed or staged in accordance with the Phoenix Regional Standard
Operating Procedures.
STARTING THE FIRE
The use of flammable or combustible liquids, as defined in NFPA-30, shall be prohibited for use in live
fire training evolutions. Only Class A materials shall be used in live fire training. The ignition process will
be conducted under the direct supervision of the Safety Officer. Command shall assign an experienced
firefighter to become "FIRESTARTER." It is the responsibility of the FIRESTARTER to initially ignite the
fire. FIRESTARTER shall also regulate the fuel load for each evolution to maintain a tenable
atmosphere inside the training fire rooms. The RIC unit shall be in place with a charged hose line prior
to ignition.
ATTACK PLAN
The officer in charge shall develop an attack plan based upon information obtained during the pre-plan
and building preparation stages.
The Attack Plan shall specify:
• Points of ignition
• Amount of fire load
• Position of entry attack lines
• Position of RIC units
• A Rescue Plan
All personnel involved in the drill shall be instructed on each element of the attack plan prior to igniting
the structure and shall receive a walk through briefing of the building prior to each training fire. An
evacuation plan and signal shall be reviewed and agreed upon.
RE-USE OF LIVE TRAINING FIRE BUILDING
The building will be re-inspected by the Safety Officer for structural integrity and for any hazards or
unsafe conditions prior to each additional training fire in the structure.

OFF SITE TRAINING BURNS
PRE-PLANNING
The officer in charge of the drill will conduct an initial inspection of the training fire site. If the building
appears acceptable, he/she will make an appointment with the Safety Officer to inspect the building.
Single-story structures shall always be considered first choice when selecting training in interior
firefighting operations. Two-story structures will only be considered when the building has been
thoroughly inspected by the Safety Officer and the Command officer. Both officers must agree that the
building is structurally sound for training burns. Adequate egress/access points on the second floor
must be readily available.
The officer coordinating the training fire will inspect the building with the Safety Officer. The building
must meet fire safety and structural integrity criteria before approval to conduct a training fire is given
by the Safety Officer. The Safety Officer shall have full authority to deny approval if the building is
determined unsafe. Buildings incapable of withstanding exposure to fire conditions shall not be utilized.
Buildings with bars on windows or doors that cannot be removed shall not be utilized.
Traffic control will also be a major factor for consideration in approving live structural training fires.
Approval will not be given where traffic cannot be effectively controlled or re-routed.
ASBESTOS CONSIDERATIONS
Prior to scheduling any training activities an asbestos consideration must be conducted by an AHERA
accredited asbestos building inspector to ensure that no asbestos is present in the structure. The
asbestos survey must follow AHERA guidelines and in addition include sampling of all materials, which
are determined by the inspector to be suspect for asbestos. This MAY include roofing components,
ceiling tiles and finishes, flooring or interior and exterior textured wall treatment layers including but not
limited to stucco and paint. Metals, wood and glass are recognized as having no potential for asbestos.
