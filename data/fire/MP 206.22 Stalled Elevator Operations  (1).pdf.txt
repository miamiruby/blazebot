PURPOSE
The removal of passengers from stalled elevators can present challenging and potentially
dangerous situations. Working around elevators may involve exposed machinery, open
hoistways, and high voltage electrical power sources. Following standard operational
procedures that ensure the safety of passengers and fire department personnel is of the utmost
importance and will reduce the chance of injury and potential damage to elevator equipment.
Incidents requiring the insertion of fire department personnel or the extrication of passengers
through the rooftop escape hatch will require a Technical Rescue Team response and lockout/tag-out measures to be in place.
PROCEDURE
Response
The fire department will only respond to stalled elevators occupied with passengers. A single
Engine Company or Ladder Company will be dispatched. If a medical emergency exists within
the elevator car, or in circumstances where the occupants are exposed to elevated summer
temperatures experienced in parking garages or exterior glass elevator cars, a Code 3 response
involving the first due Engine or Ladder with a TRT component will be dispatched.
Elevator Service Contractor ETA
The Alarm Room will ask the initial caller if they have contacted the elevator service contractor
for the building and note their ETA. Responses in many cases are 20-30 minutes during normal
business hours. This information should be factored into the incident action plan for removal of
occupants.
Elevator Car Location
The position of the elevator car can be determined from the elevator status panel in the fire
control room if available, or the floor level indication at the elevator bank. Occupants inside the
car may also be able to tell their location by the floor position indicator lights inside the car.
Communication with Occupants
Initial communication with occupants should occur as soon as possible to reassure them that
actions are being taken to remove them from the car and to determine if anyone inside has any
injuries or immediate medical issues. Information gathered from occupants should include:
• The number of occupants
• The indicated floor level
• Whether the emergency stop button has been mistakenly activated
• If the interior lights and fans are on

Recall Procedures (Phase 1)
Using the firefighters service operation key, found in the buildings fire control room or
emergency keys location, place the emergency recall key switch to the “ON” position (Phase 1)
(Fig. 1.3.1) to recall the elevator car to the main floor. *If the car is stalled due to a power outage
within the building, and the building is equipped with a standby or emergency power source, it
may be possible to run the elevators by turning the emergency recall switch in the main floor
lobby to the “ON” position. Use the manual elevator standby power selection switch (typically
located in the buildings fire control room) to bring the cars to the main floor, one at a time.

Power Reset
If recall procedures are unsuccessful, at least two crew members should be sent the elevator
mechanical room with building keys, flashlights, portable radio, and forcible entry tools, if keys
are unavailable. The remaining crew members should access the floor nearest the stalled car
and establish voice communications with the car occupants. Members in the mechanical room
will locate the power switch controls for the stalled elevator. The larger (208v-600v) switch
controls power to the elevator car and the smaller 120v switch controls the interior lights and
fans. In coordination with crew members at the car location, the larger (208v-600v) switch will be
shut down to the “OFF” position for 30 seconds then turned to the “ON” position to reset the
breaker. (Fig. 1.3.2) Once power is reestablished, the occupants will be directed to push a floor
button on the panel. If there is no response, the larger (208v-600v) power switch will again be
placed in the “OFF” position and remain off while the evacuation of the elevator takes place.
Crew members must remain in place in the mechanical room at the switch location until the
evacuation is complete or lock-out/tag-out is in place.

Opening Hoistway Doors
The position of the elevator car in relation to the floor level can be determined by slightly
separating the outer hoistway doors and looking in the gap for the bottom or top of the car.
If the car is at or near a landing (see figure 1.3.3), the hoistway doors may be unlocked and the
hoistway and car doors can be opened by hand using the following steps:
• Assure main 208v-600v power is secured in the “OFF” position from crew members in the
in the elevator mechanical room.
• Open the doors, access the car, and secure the emergency stop switch in the “STOP” or
“OFF” position.
• Assist occupants out of the car.

If the car is within 3 feet of the landing (see figure 1.3.4(a)), the hoistway doors will be locked
and will need to be accessed using the elevator interlock release key (drop key or crescent key)
using the following steps:
• Assure main 208v-600V power is secured in the “OFF” position from crew members in
the elevator mechanical room.
• Open the hoistway door using the appropriate elevator interlock release key and open the
car door by hand.
• Open the doors, access the car, and secure the emergency stop switch in the “STOP” or
“OFF” position.
• Place a barrier (ground ladder) across hoistway opening if the car is above the floor level.
• Assist occupants out of the car.

Forcible Entry
If hoistway doors cannot be unlocked by hand or the elevator interlock release key, the hoistway
door nearest to the stalled car can be forcibly opened using forcible entry tools. To assure safety
and minimize door damage, the following steps should be taken.
• Assure main 208v-600v power is secured in the “OFF” position from crew members in the
elevator mechanical room.
• Center opening doors should be forced with tools from the top of the doors where they
meet. Side opening doors should be forced from the side the door closes into.
• Place a barrier (ground ladder) across hoistway opening if the car is above the floor level.
• A crew member should access the car and secure the emergency stop switch in the
“STOP” or “OFF” position.
• Assist occupants out of the car.

Roof-top Extrication (TRT)
Incidents requiring the insertion of fire department personnel or the extrication of passengers
through the rooftop escape hatch will require a Technical Rescue Team response and lockout/tag-out measures to be in place.
