Page 1 of 2

POLICY
It is the policy of the Phoenix Fire Department to provide the best possible care to all patients
encountered. It is anticipated that most events involving biological agents will not generate a
scene to which personnel could respond. This is the case because biological agents are slow
acting and the public health surveillance systems may require days to detect patterns of
causalities. It is also possible in a biological incident that victims at the scene may exhibit no
symptoms.
PURPOSE
The purpose of the bio-exposure information card is to capture information that may be used in
epidemiological tracking. A copy of the bio-exposure information card is contained on page 2
of this procedure. The bio-exposure information card when completed will contain the
following information:
Front of card

Back of card

Date of incident
Victim name, address, phone number(s)
Destination from scene
Symptomatic/EMS evaluation (Y or N)

Date of incident
Probable exposure
Location of exposure
Notification of MCDPH*
Arrival/Departure airline
(If airport incident)

PROCEDURE
If the medical decision is to allow asymptomatic victims to leave the scene or there are
victims that are demanding to leave the scene, a bio-exposure card will be completed prior to
their departure from the scene. In the event that the scene is at Sky Harbor, the cards will be
collected from all passengers who arrive on aircraft where (1) there is evidence of or (2)
credible reason to suspect exposure has taken place. Completed bio-exposure cards will be
forwarded via interoffice mail to EMS/Public Health Programs Manager. Copies of the cards
are to be provided to MCDPH* and Epidemiology Section of the AzDHS**.
RESPONSIBILITIES
Bio-exposure information cards are available for use on all apparatus. Reorder of cards
through information services via the district offices.
* MCDPH is Maricopa County Department of Public Health
**AzDHS is Arizona Department of Health Services
