M.P. 205.23
MR & LA UNITS
This policy is for internal use only and does not expand an employee’s legal duty or civil
liability in any way. This policy should not be construed as creating a duty to act or a higher
duty of care, with respect to third party civil claims against employees or the Phoenix Fire
Department (PFD). Remedies for violations of this policy, if proven, are limited to
administrative disciplinary action against PFD employees.

PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish the capabilities and functions of non-traditional units
and define their role in regional response. Defining the role of each unit will allow incident
commanders, dispatchers, and company officers to call for and deploy the appropriate resource
who can best accomplish the operational need.
POLICY
The following definitions will serve to outline the capabilities and functions of the non-traditional
resources operating throughout the automatic-aid system. The Central Arizona Life Safety System
Response Council requires that all fire stations have at least one NFPA 1710 compliant fire engine
company in every fire station. This procedure is not intended to limit the scope of non-traditional
units when individuals with sufficient training, certifications, and PPE are available to meet a
critical operational need.
MEDICAL RESPONSE UNIT (MR)
MRs are fully staffed 4-person crews with a qualified engineer and company officer. These units
primarily respond to medical calls and can fulfill all normal EMS response requirements based on
the unit’s level of EMS certification (ALS/BLS). On fire incidents, a MR can be used to supplement
general firefighting duties as assigned by command. MRs cannot replace an engine, ladder, or
squad company for fire suppression, rescue, and special operations type incidents.
• Staffing: 4-person crew including two firefighters, one engineer and one captain.
• Hazard Zone Capability: All crew members are trained firefighters and can operate in a
hazard zone.
• EMS Capability: Primarily staffed as an ALS unit but can be staffed BLS when personnel
limitations dictate.

Limitations: MRs utilize a smaller vehicle than a traditional fire engine or ladder. These
smaller units provide less protection when operating near moving traffic. Company officers
and incident commanders should consider a back-up unit to support MRs operating under
these conditions. MRs do not carry hose, water or ladders; this means the personnel can
support firefighting operations, but the vehicle will have limited usefulness.

MR Units may only respond to incidents without the support of another unit on the following
nature code categories: BLS, ALS, SERV and MISC SERVICE.
LOW ACUITY UNITS (LA)
LA units are staffed by 2-person crews that are trained firefighters. LA units primarily respond to
low acuity incidents when a four-person crew may not be required. These units offer limited
capabilities to respond to critical emergency incidents and should be backed up by an Engine,
Ladder, or Squad (all hazards company) when the incident dictates. LA units may respond to fires
in certain jurisdictions but should only be assigned by command to support an appropriately
staffed, NFPA 1710 compliant, 4-person fire company when conducting firefighting operations. LA
units can be assigned in the same way a 2-person rescue unit operates on the fireground.
• Staffing: 2-person crew that varies in certifications and rank.
• EMS Capability: May have ALS or BLS members but only fulfills the personnel requirement
for low acuity BLS calls.
• Limitations: LA units will not usually have a company officer and should be supervised by
another unit when operating on large incidents. LA units are designed to meet very low
acuity needs and should be backed-up by personnel or an appropriate all-hazards unit if an
LA is assigned to any other task.
LA Units may only respond to low acuity type incidents without the support of another unit on the
following nature codes:

***The list above represents nature codes for which an LA Unit may respond if personnel have
the proper training and equipment. Decisions regarding which nature codes from the list above
an LA Unit can respond to will be made by the individual Fire Department.
MR & LA UNIT FUNCTION WITHIN AUTOMATIC AID
The automatic aid agreement establishes that participating departments deploy the closest most
appropriate resources to emergencies, regardless of municipal boundaries. Also, the automatic
aid agreement allows some flexibility for the deployment of specialized units when predefined by
Phoenix Regional Standard Operating Procedures.
The Central Arizona Life Safety System Response Council allows the establishment of predefined
response areas for MR and LA Units within municipal boundaries. MR and LA Units are required
to be deployed across these predefined municipal boundaries when they are the closest unit to a
type of call where an imminent threat to life is presumed as follows:
1. Codes
2. Childbirth
3. Person, Child, or Infant Choking
4. Drowning
5. ALS Seizure
LA Units are to be deployed on these incidents across municipal boundaries to supplement the
response if they are identified as the closest unit; they shall not be deployed in replacement of
other units. Additionally, a gunshot wound involving a law enforcement officer is included as it is
likely that the officer will be extracted from the hot-zone immediately by other officers to a coldzone where treatment can occur rapidly.
On all the above incidents, consideration for the need of an MR or LA Unit must be evaluated by
the responding Company Officer, and when applicable, Command Officer. When the incident does
not necessitate the need for an MR or LA response, these units should be canceled whenever
reasonable. Like all fire companies, MR and LA Units should maintain awareness when not in
quarters of incidents around them and may request to add on to critical calls when they believe
their response will make a positive difference on the incident outcome.
***With Department approval, an MR will be dispatched to all MR approved nature codes (BLS,
ALS, SERV and MISC SERVICE) when the MR is closest unit.
