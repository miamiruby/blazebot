SCOPE
This procedure establishes a standard structure and guideline for all fire department personnel
operating at incidents involving confined space rescues. The procedure outlines responsibilities
for first-responders, TRT units, Command Officers, and other fire department personnel
responding to such incidents. All other Phoenix Fire Department procedures shall apply to
confined space rescue operations where applicable.
PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines for the response of fire department
personnel and equipment to confined space rescue incidents. Because confined space rescue
operations present a significant danger to fire department personnel, the safe and effective
management of these operations require special considerations. This procedure identifies some
of the critical issues which must be included in managing these incidents.
TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
OSHA Regulations Standard 29 CFR 1910.146 Permit-Required Confined Spaces regulates
entry into confined spaces for general industry and the rescue service and shall be considered
the basis for confined space rescue operations. For the purpose of emergency response, a
confined space is defined as:
•
•
•

A space large enough for personnel to physically enter.
A space not designed for continuous employee occupancy.
An area with limited entry and egress.

Confined spaces include caverns, tunnels, pipes, tanks, mine shafts, utility vaults, and any other
location where ventilation and access are restricted by the configuration of the space. These
factors may also apply to basements and attics. Confined space incidents may involve injured
persons or persons asphyxiated or overcome by toxic substances. Pre-incident planning is an
important factor in preparing to handle these types of incidents.
Due to the inherent dangers associated with these operations, the Phoenix Fire Department
Risk Management Profile shall be applied to all confined space rescue operations and shall be
continuously re-assessed throughout the incident. A phased approach to confined space rescue
operations which include; Arrival, Pre-entry operations, Entry operations, and Termination, can
be utilized to safely and effectively mitigate these high-risk / low-frequency events.

Additional technical information is available in the issued Technical Rescue Field
Operations Guide.
