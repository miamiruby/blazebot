PURPOSE
The objective of the Emergency Operations Plan is to mobilize the resources of the entire
Phoenix Fire Department to an elevated level when circumstances require a commitment
beyond normal capabilities. The activation of this plan will cause the Fire Department Tactical
Operations Center (TOC) to go into operation. Identified Command Officers will respond to that
location. The general categories of situations that would cause the activation of the TOC:
• One major incident affecting a localized or widespread area.
• Two or more working incidents causing a high demand for resources at different
locations.
• Numerous simultaneous incidents causing a peak demand on the entire system.
• When determined necessary by the Fire Chief or Executive Staff.
The purpose of the TOC will be to bring appropriate Command Officers and other staff together
at a central location and to:
• Analyze the emergency situation.
• Determine what Fire Department and other City resources are needed for the
emergency.
• Place additional apparatus in service as deemed necessary.
• Recall appropriate personnel resources as necessary.
• Make Fire Department policy regarding the department’s response and management of
the emergency.
• Prioritize response and resources as necessary (see Emergency Deployment, M.P.
201.02A)
• Select and provide personnel to staff the City's Emergency Operations Center if opened.
Each Division of the Fire Department is assigned specific roles and responsibilities in order to
support emergency operations. It is the responsibility of each Division and Section to be
prepared to function according to these guidelines whenever the need is identified.
TOC IMMEDIATE TASKS AND DECISIONS
Command Staff reporting to the TOC will be responsible for the following decisions and tasks:
• Confirm that Emergency Response Staffing Office (ERSO) is manned and prepared to
initiate recall, if needed.
• Determine the need for and initiate additional staffing of the Alarm Room.
• Confirm an TOC liaison is established and functioning at the Incident Command Post(s).
• Determine the need for a TOC Liaison at the Alarm Room (preferably the Alarm Room
Chief).
• Confirm that resource management has been opened to address any identified logistical
needs. This may include preparation of reserve apparatus and deployment of
specialized equipment.
