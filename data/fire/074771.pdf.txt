SCOPE
This procedure establishes a standard structure and guideline for all fire department personnel
operating at incidents involving mountain rescue operations. The procedure outlines
responsibilities for first-responders, TRT units, Command Officers, and other fire department
personnel responding to such incidents. All other Phoenix Fire Department procedures shall
apply to mountain rescue operations where applicable.
PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines for the response of fire department
personnel and equipment to mountain rescue incidents which utilize ropes and/or rope systems,
or a rescue helicopter, to affect a rescue. Because mountain rescue operations present a
significant danger to fire department personnel, the safe and effective management of these
operations require special considerations. This procedure identifies some of the critical issues
which must be included in managing these incidents.
TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Rope rescue is defined as any rescue attempt that requires rope and/or rope systems and
related equipment to safely gain access to, and remove patients from hazardous geographic
areas/locations with limited access. The two categories of rescue are:
• Non-Technical - rescues with angles of inclination less than 40º. Most firstresponders have the equipment and training to affect this type of rescue.
• Technical - rescues with angles of inclination from 40º to 90º. These rescues
typically involve ropes and /or rope systems and shall be performed by rescuers
trained to the level of Technical Rescue Technician (TRT).
All rope rescue techniques and equipment utilized in rescue operations shall meet the intent of
the following standards as established by the National Fire Protection Association:
•
•
•

NFPA 1670 Standard on Operations and Training for Technical Search & Rescue
Incidents
NFPA 1006 Standard for Technical Rescuer Professional Qualifications.
NFPA 1983 Standard on Life Safety Rope & Equipment for Emergency Services.

Due to the inherent dangers associated with these operations, the Phoenix Fire Department
Risk Management Profile shall be applied to all mountain rescue operations and shall be
continuously re-assessed throughout the incident. A phased approach to mountain rescue
operations which include; Arrival, Pre-rescue operations, Rescue operations, and Termination,
can be utilized to safely and effectively mitigate these high-risk / low-frequency events.
Additional technical information is available in the issued Technical Rescue Field
Operations Guide.

Arrival.

I. ESTABLISH COMMAND
A. First arriving company officer shall assume Command and begin an immediate sizeup of the situation while ascending the mountain with medical equipment to provide
treatment for any victim(s) in need of medical care.
B. First arriving TRT unit that is staffed with a TRT Company Officer should be assigned
Rescue Sector. The TRT Company Officer assigned as Rescue Sector should
remain with his crew and ascend the mountain with the necessary equipment to
conduct the rescue. Rescue Sector responsibilities include:
•
•
•
•
•

Assuming technical rescue operations control.
Identifying hazards and critical factors.
Developing a rescue plan and back-up plan.
Communicating with and directing TRT resources assigned to Rescue Sector.
Informing Command of conditions, actions, and needs during all phases of the
rescue operation.

C. Designate a Safety Officer per NFPA 1670. Considerations for Safety Officer include:
•
•
•

One of the Regional Special Operations qualified Safety Officers.
A Special Operations qualified Battalion Chief and/or FIT
Any experienced TRT Company Officer assigned to the incident.

D. Following the transfer of Command to a Command Officer, a Technical Advisor
should be assigned to join the Command Team at their location to assist in
managing personnel and resources engaged in the technical aspects of the incident.
The Technical Advisor is responsible for ensuring that the rescue plan developed by
Rescue Sector and communicated to Command is a sound plan in terms of the
safety and welfare of both victim(s) and rescuers. Considerations for the Technical
Advisor include:
•
•
•

A Special Operations qualified Battalion Chief and/or FIT.
One of the Regional Special Operations qualified Safety Officers.
Any experienced TRT Company Officer assigned to the incident.

The Technical Advisor position within the Command Team should be filled prior to the
implementation of any rescue plan proposed by Rescue Sector.
II. Size-Up
A. Secure a witness or park ranger to assist in gathering information to determine the
location and condition of victim(s). If no witnesses are present, and no other source
of information is available, Command should consider calling for a police helicopter
(Firebird) to locate the victim(s) on the mountain.
B. Assess the immediate and potential hazards to the rescuers.
C. Assess on-scene capabilities and determine the need for additional resources.

Pre-rescue Operations

It must be determined if this will be a RESCUE operation or a RECOVERY operation
based on the survivability profile of the victim(s) which include factors such as the
location and condition of the victim(s), and elapsed time since the accident occurred.
I. MAKE THE RESCUE AREA SAFE
A. Secure the area and remove all non-essential civilian personnel. If it is not possible to
secure all of the hazards, rescue personnel operating in the area must be made
aware of the hazard(s).
B. Control foot traffic on the trail.
C. Assemble all necessary personnel, rescue equipment, and patient packaging
equipment that will be required for the rescue operation.
Phase III

Rescue Operations

Technical rescue operations shall be conducted under the direction of Rescue Sector by
trained Technical Rescue Technicians.
I. ROPE RESCUE OPERATIONS
Rescue Sector responsibilities shall include the following:
A. Ensure that all personnel operating in Rescue Sector are accounted for and wearing
appropriate PPE.
B. Develop a rescue plan and a back-up plan.
•

Consider the risk management profile and survivability profile to develop an
appropriate rescue plan.

•

The rescue plan shall be developed considering the least amount of risk to
rescuers that is necessary to affect the rescue. Low-risk operations are not
always possible, but should be considered first.

•

High-risk operations shall be decided upon through consultation with Rescue
Sector, Safety, Command, and the Technical Advisor.

•

A back-up plan shall be in place prior to initiating rescue operations.

C. Ensure the rescue plan and back-up plan, which include emergency procedures, are
communicated to all personnel operating on the incident.
II.

HELICOPTER OPERATIONS
Helicopter operations are considered high-risk and shall be decided upon through
consultation with Rescue Sector, Safety, Command, and the Technical Advisor. Factors
to consider in the use of a rescue helicopter include:
•
•
•
•
•

Condition of the patient.
Difficult access.
Difficult terrain.
Time of day.
Environmental effects on rescuers.
