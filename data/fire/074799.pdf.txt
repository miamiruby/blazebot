PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish guidelines for the response of Fire Department personnel and
equipment to an aircraft emergency at the Glendale Airport.
DISPATCH TERMINOLOGY
Aircraft emergencies are broken down into three categories: Alert 1, Alert 2, and Alert 3.
Alert 1: Indicates an aircraft is having minor difficulties (i.e., a minor oil leak; one engine out on a three or
four-engine commercial aircraft or one engine out on a two-engine general aviation aircraft; fire
warning lights; etc.) A safe landing is expected.
Alert 2: Indicates that an aircraft is having major difficulties (i.e. a positive indication of fire on board the
aircraft; faulty landing gear; no hydraulic pressure; engine failure on a two-engine large aircraft;
etc.) A difficult or crash landing may be expected.
Alert 3: Indicates that an aircraft has crashed on or off the airport, or there is a high probability the aircraft
will crash, or the pilot has indicated that the landing gear will not work, and therefore, they will
have to crash land on the airport.
