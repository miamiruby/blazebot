In the aftermath of large-scale fire incidents, the Incident Commander may request fire companies for
extended overhaul or standby. The Dispatch Center, in conjunction with the Incident Commander or
Planning Section, will determine the following:
•
•
•
•

Approximate duration of the overhaul period.
Number of units needed for each rotation.
Time interval for rotation of relief units.
Specific equipment needs.

Taking into consideration the above criteria, the Dispatch Center will develop a plan to deploy
companies for the extent of the overhaul period. The rotation plan will be developed using the following
criteria:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Any company that participated for a substantial period of time at the incident should not be
placed on the rotation list.
Companies that have had high levels of activity during the shift should not be placed on the list
unless it is absolutely necessary. Unit histories should be checked for the day and companies
that have had the least amount of activity should be selected.
ALS and BLS coverage needs should be evaluated to maintain adequate regional coverage in
the response system.
Multiple units from the same geographic area should not be used.
When a plan is developed to deploy multiple units for extended overhaul, the companies
involved will be notified in advance if possible. Notification will include the time to respond, the
duration of their assignment and who their relief will be.
Time of day and travel distances should be taken into consideration if they are a critical factor.
When an outlying company is selected for rotation, an adaptive response unit not used on the
incident should cover for that company. If an adaptive response unit is not available or does not
fall under the above criteria, outlying units should not be used unless absolutely necessary.

Every attempt will be made to adhere to the above criteria in developing the overhaul rotation list.
During times of high activity, some exceptions may be made to allow adequate regional coverage at all
times. This element of deployment should be a regular component of the selection process in the
Dispatch and Deployment Section.
