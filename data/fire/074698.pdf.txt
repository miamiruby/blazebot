Post-incident critiques of major and significant incidents provides an opportunity to review the
effectiveness of actions and procedures in their application during actual incidents. It is also an
opportunity to review the overall quality of the services provided to the customers at the incident. This
review is extremely valuable in improving procedures and incident operations. Formal departmental
critiques will be conducted at the discretion of the Tactical Services Chief.
Critique Sector--Implementation
An incident Critique Sector may be utilized at major incidents. This sector will be implemented
automatically by the Training Academy officer responding to the incident. Command must be notified of
the Critique Sector's establishment. In the absence of an Training Academy officer, the Tactical
Services chief or the Incident Commander will designate a fire officer to implement this Sector.
A critique "team" may also be implemented as part of the Critique Sector at greater alarms, or other
significant incidents at the request of Command, to prepare and conduct a critique. Command must be
notified of the Critique Sector's establishment. The Tactical Services Chief, or his/her designee, will
select team members and make critique assignments.
Critique--Sector Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Critique Sector will be:
*

*
*
*

Produce a drawing of the incident layout and other details needed for a critique. This includes a
drawing of the building or incident site with appropriate dimensions, apparatus placement, size and
positions of hose lines and master streams, accountability locations, etc.
Provide descriptive notes of observations related to actions and effectiveness of companies and
sectors, unique problems, etc.
Coordinate and ensure the photography/videography of the incident by the fire department
personnel.
Complete/Coordinate any other request of the Incident Commander, or operations officer as related
to critique preparation.

Post-Incident Preparation
Post incident preparation for a critique will begin immediately following a major incident. The shift
commander or battalion chief will determine the need for a critique and initiate the post-incident
preparation once the incident is identified as one which will be critiqued. The Tactical Services Section
will assist in gathering information and coordination of the critique.
Determining Critique Levels
The incident may qualify for one of five levels of critique. The Assistant Chief of Operations, or
designee, will determine the level at which the incident will be critiqued. The Tactical Services Section
will coordinate and/or conduct the critique.

1. Individual--Conducted within the individual company by the company officer. May include other
companies. Usually self initiated by the company officer. No documentation of the critique
required.
2. Company Level--Post-incident critique conducted on site, prior to departing the scene. Initiated
by Command or battalion chief. Informal and brief.
3. Battalion Level--Initiated and organized by the battalion chief. Scheduled assembly of the
necessary companies as soon as possible after the incident. Structured critique format.
Battalion chief completes critique analysis form and forwards to the Tactical Services Section.
4. Operations Level--Conducted within the battalion by the battalion chief or Shift Commander.
This may be a first alarm or multiple-alarm incident, or other significant incident whose site
operations were uncomplicated, and generally did not involve a large response of fire
department resource or outside agencies. A standard critique packet will be utilized to prepare
for and conduct the critique. A critique summary will be completed. All critique materials and
documents will be forwarded to the Tactical Services Section for filing.
5. Department Level--Utilized for critiquing large-scale or complex incidents that involved a large
response of fire department resources and several outside agencies or incidents that were
unusual or tactically significant occurrences. A chief officer will be selected to prepare and
conduct the critique. A team may be assigned to assist also. A standard critique packet will be
utilized to prepare for and conduct the critique. A critique summary will be completed. All
critique materials and documents will be forwarded to the Tactical Services Section. The
Tactical Services Section will be responsible for coordinating the date and location of
department level critiques and making Buckslip and other notifications.
This critique will require greater coordination, investigation, and preparation. It will be conducted at a
selected location to accommodate a large attendance.
Critique Preparation Packet
Since a major incident affects all divisions and sections of the department in one degree or another, the
operations and department level critique will review the total incident response rather than just simply
the site operations aspects of the incident. A thorough critique of major incidents may require the
assistance of several divisions or sections. Therefore, the following Divisions and Sections will be
asked to submit at least the following information/materials. Turnaround for submitting the information
to the Tactical Services chief will be ten (10) calendar days.
Urban Services--Code Enforcement Section
* Submit a summary of the building fire inspections history and history of fire code violations,
including a list or a summary of the number and types of Certificates of Occupancy's that have been
issued and any building alterations or other modifications that have been made.
