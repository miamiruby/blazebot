Policy Statement
It is the policy of the Phoenix Regional Department to provide assistance to people involved in
emergency incidents who may not need emergency medical care but still need support to recover from
the situation.
Purpose
The goal of the District Van Volunteer Program is to provide assistance for non-emergency activities; to
provide an alternate means of transporting family members not requiring standard ambulance
transportation, and other assistance to the public.
The District Van may also be utilized to assist fire companies in retrieving medical equipment and
paramedics from hospitals.
Operating Hours
The District Van will be staffed by fire cadets or trained volunteers. Hours of service may vary
according to the availability of volunteer personnel and the hours they may be available to work.

service at the end of each shift. The Service Van will assume the radio identity of " District Van-5,"
followed by their assignment (i.e., District Van-5).
Dispatch
The District Van can only be dispatched following the request of a fire department member, who is on
the scene. The District Van is a non-emergency vehicle and will respond Code 2.
If an incident number has not yet been assigned to the request, Dispatch will assign an incident number
and will log times of dispatch, arrival, departure and destination arrival. The District Van will
acknowledge response and report/announce on scene, departure and destination arrival times via radio
or MDT.
