Medical Supply Sector
Major incidents rapidly consume standard complements of medical supplies carried by fire companies.
Since, large multi-casualty incidents (MCIs) require a significant amount of EMS supplies and generate
large quantities of biohazard waste, additional supplies must be obtained and delivered to the site.
To improve the fire department’s capability to treat patients arising from a large-scale multiple patient
incident, a Medical Supply Sector shall be established during all 3-Alarm Medical (or greater) major medical
incidents using a minimum of one fire company. Additionally, Dispatch will special call Medical Support 19
from the airport and an EMS supply truck from Resource Management to the scene.
The Medical Supply Sector will be staffed with members from the assigned fire company, the personnel
assigned to MS19, and the EMS supply truck, with the company officer assigned as as the Medical Supply
Sector Officer. A second EMS supply truck and a second adaptive response unit will be dispatched to the
scene following an upgrade to a 4-Alarm Medical incident.
The Medical Supply Sector should be established in close proximity to the treatment area. At expanded
incidents, the Medical Supply Sector may be assigned to the Logistics Section.
At incidents with less than 20 patients, Medical Supply Sector will report to Command. At larger mass
casualty incidents, this Sector will report to Medical Branch or Logistics Section.
