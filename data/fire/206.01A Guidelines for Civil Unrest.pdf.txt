For many decades, the fire service has been called along with law enforcement to intervene in
incidents involving civil unrest. Any civil unrest has the potential to cause for an increase in emergency
calls. Civil unrest events can change quickly, and we have excellent SOP’s that govern our response.
The following is provided to supplement our policies with some guidance for our response to an
incident involving civil unrest:
IMPORTANT SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS:
• No single company responses will be permitted in the predefined area (geo fence).
• All responses shall be coordinated with law enforcement and will include force protection/escort.
• Use of sirens and air horns should be avoided within the immediate area, lights may be used.
• Position apparatus in a manner that will allow for rapid, unobstructed retreat from the area.
Also, apparatus must be parked in a manner that best protects the crew.
• Be smart with regard to your behavior. Stay alert and aware of what is happening around you
and your crew. Back off and away from any potentially violent situation. Don’t fuel civil unrest.
TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
• In most cases, patients will be more effectively treated if removed from the scene to a
determined treatment area (scoop and run). A great practice is for law enforcement to bring
patients to us.
• When no lives are at stake, emphasis will be on protecting savable property. Buildings,
vehicles, etc. that are fully involved with no or little exposure problem may be left to burn.
• When safe and well-coordinated, fire suppression efforts will have an emphasis on fast water,
heavy streams to rapidly control and extinguish the fire and then to get out of the area. Routine
salvage, ventilation, and overhaul practices may be discontinued. Use of hand lines should be
limited. Roof operations should be avoided and ladder buildings only when necessary for
rescue efforts.
• All fire units will enter the perimeter as intact groups with law enforcement, travel in groups,
operate in groups, and return in groups.
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
• Any civil unrest has the potential of escalating into a major situation.
• Chief Officers will be added to all responses to provide for additional member safety in known
areas of civil unrest.
• Fire Departments should be prepared to support law enforcement partners with rehabilitation of
officers, treatment, and transportation as necessary.
• Terrorism Liaison Officers (TLO) are extremely valuable to assist with coordination of efforts.
TLOs should be utilized at the tactical and strategic levels whenever possible.
• When multiple Emergency Operations Centers, Incident Management Teams, or other similar
systems are operating regionally, information sharing amongst leaders is a best practice.
