Protective clothing inspections will use the following inspection criteria to evaluate the
condition of protective clothing. Each item will be rated in at least one of the five categories:
1. New
2. Good
3. Fair
4. Exposed
5. Condemned
Cleaning and decontamination of soiled or contaminated ensemble elements must take place
before additional inspection occurs. Cleaning and decontamination are important in
maintaining the integrity of the gear and in reducing exposure to carcinogens.
The following elements should be checked as part of a routine inspection:
•
•
•

Soiling
Contamination
Physical damage such as the following:
o Rips, tears and cuts.
o Damaged or missing hardware and closure systems.
o Thermal damage (charring, burn holes, melting, discoloration of any layer).
o Damaged or missing reflective trim.
o Loss of seam integrity and broken or missing stitches.

Protective clothing inspections will be conducted at least one time annually, during Battalion
turnout cleaning. All members are to inspect their turnouts as part of their daily morning
routine and report any issue they may encounter. Each member is responsible for the cleaning,
care and maintenance of each set of protective clothing ensemble, and also responsible for
obtaining repairs when needed by following established Resource Management procedures.
Contaminated Protective Ensembles will be collected on a daily basis from fire stations with
coordination through Resource Management. Resource Management will clean, inspect and
repair, if necessary, any documented needs by the member turning in their ensemble. Resource
will do their best to get the clean ensemble returned to the member before the start of their
next shift.
Resource Management will track and document each set of Protective Ensemble by scanning
every set into their database.
Protective ensembles that need to be replaced will be exchanged at Resource Management at
the earliest opportunity. An electronic Lost, Stolen or Damaged Report(LSD) will need to be

chemical degradation has occurred. During inspections, helmets will be checked for these
conditions and the shell will be replaced immediately if they are evident.
