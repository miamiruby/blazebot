Treatment protocols described here include drugs and procedures that are administered
both by pre‐hospital (CEP) personnel and hospital personnel. Thus, some drug administrations
and procedures are outside the paramedic scope of practice.
The following treatment protocols have been reviewed by the PFD Medical Director, members
of the Board of Directors of Arizona Emergency Medical Services (the regional emergency
medical services association for physicians), and Maricopa County Public Health Department
Medical Director. Network hospital personnel (physicians) were also consulted in developing
and modifying the protocols.
Treatment protocols for radiological/nuclear agents are addressed in Phoenix Regional
Department Standard Operating Procedure M.P. 204.03 Radiological Hazards and are not
included here.

Chlorine
Military Designation: CL
Description: Chlorine is found as an amber liquid or greenish‐yellow gas with a very
characteristic irritating, pungent odor. Chlorine is severely irritating to the skin, eyes, and
respiratory tract. Although generally stored as a liquid, when released, the resulting gas is
about two times heavier than air.
Non‐Military Uses: Chlorine is used widely in industrial settings in the organic synthesis and
manufacture of antifreeze agents, solvents, refrigerants, resins, bleaching agents, and other
inorganic chemicals. There is an exceptionally wide use of chlorine in non‐commercial and
home settings as a cleaning agent, bleaching agent, bacteriostatic, and disinfecting agent.
Storage of this substance in a variety of liquid and granular forms is widespread.

Treatment Protocol






General
o Chlorine is found as a greenish‐yellow gas, with a pungent, acrid, characteristic
odor. Sensitivity to the odor is below toxic levels; however, since some sensory
adaptation occurs, repeat exposures are more likely to produce toxic effects.
Exposures irritate eyes and central (upper) airways within minutes. Low doses
produce some cough and choking sensation. Moderate doses also produce a
sense of suffocation, hoarseness, and substernal pain. High doses also produce a
severe dyspnea, with pulmonary edema, nausea, vomiting, headache, syncope
also seen. Very high doses may produce sudden death without an obvious
pulmonary lesion, possibly via laryngospasm. All recognized exposures should be
referred for direct observation/care.
Patient Evaluation
o Victims should be immediately removed from the toxic environment by fully
masked personnel. Chemical protective clothing is required for liquid/solution
exposures.
o Liquid contamination causes eye and skin burns on contact. Contaminated
clothing should be removed/disposed of.
Treatment
o Eyes: Liquid exposures should be flushed with copious quantities of water. Gas
exposures, if symptomatic, should be flushed with water.
o Skin: Liquid exposures should be flushed with copious quantities of water;
contaminated clothing should be removed/disposed of. Gas exposures require
no specific therapy unless symptomatic. Intense gas exposure produces burns;
wash with water.
o Breathing: Evaluate respiration, cyanosis, bronchospasm.
 If apneic: CPR with intubation. Be aware that laryngospasm may be
present with intense exposures, hence intubation may be very difficult,
and surgical cricothyrotomy could be required. Medical attention should
be sought.
 If stridorous/hoarse: Consider intubation under direct vision since
laryngospasm may be imminent (see above). Medical attention should be
sought.

If dyspnea/cough/chest tightness: Consider intubation for impending
pulmonary edema. Also consider possible bronchospasm sufficiently
severe to have so little air exchange that wheezes are absent. Medical
attention should be sought. Codeine‐containing demulcents may help. Be
wary of sedation.
If bronchospasm: Provide aggressive bronchodilation:
o Adult:
 Inhaled albuterol: unit dose q 2 hr.
 Steroids: methyl prednisone, load 120 mg IV, then 60 mg q 6 hr.
 Theophylline: load 150 mg IV, then 30 mg/hr.
o Infants and children (0‐12 yr):
 Inhaled albuterol: 0.15 mg/kg per nebulized dose up to 5 mg/20
minutes for first 2 hr.
 Steroids: methyl prednisone: 1 mg/kg IV q 6 hr.
 Theophylline: 10 mg/kg IV/24 hr.
o Elderly:
 Inhaled albuterol: unit dose q 3 hr.
 Steroids: methyl prednisone, load 125 mg IV, then 60 mg q 6 hr.
 Theophylline (occasional use): load 100 mg IV, then 25 mg/hr.
If asymptomatic: Maintain direct observation for at least 1 hour; if
becomes symptomatic, treat as above. If still asymptomatic, continue to
recheck every hour for additional 12 hours since some bronchospasm
may appear late.
If hypoxic from bronchospasm, administer bronchodilators and
supplemental oxygen. If hypoxic from pulmonary edema: oxygen may be
utilized with positive pressure (ventilation after intubation).
If pulmonary edema occurs: Treat as noncardiac pulmonary edema (Adult
Respiratory Distress Syndrome or ARDS) with positive pressure
ventilation afterwards. Diuretic therapy is not indicated.
Inhalation exposures may produce pulmonary infiltrates, fever, and white
blood cell elevations leading to an erroneous diagnosis of (presumed
bacterial) pneumonia. Prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated.
Surveillance bacteriologic cultures are obtained anticipating an
approximate 50% risk of nosocomial pneumonia at days 3‐6.

Note: The anatomical configuration of infants' and children's airways
makes wheezing a less reliable indicator of bronchospasm. Severe small
airway constriction with resultant hypoxia may be present. Any apparent
infant or child respiratory distress should be immediately assessed with
oximetry.

Hydrocyanic Acid, Hydrogen Cyanide and Cyanogen Chloride
Military Designations: AC (hydrocyanic acid) and CK (cyanogen chloride)
Description: Both of these substances are liquids, but they vaporize (evaporate) at about 73/F
and 58/C, so they will be in the gaseous form under most temperate conditions. AC has an odor
of bitter almonds; CK is pungent. AC vapor is lighter than air, whereas CK gas is heavier than air.
Cyanogen chloride is quickly metabolized to cyanide once absorbed into the body and causes
the same biological effects as hydrogen cyanide. In addition, CK is irritating to the eyes, nose,
and throat (similar to riot control agents), whereas AC is nonirritating.
Non‐Military Uses: Large amounts of cyanide (most in the form of salts) are produced,
transported, and used by U.S. industry annually. Cyanide is used in fumigation, photography,
extraction of metals, electroplating, metal cleaning, tempering of metals, and the synthesis of
many compounds. It is released when synthetic fibers and plastics burn.
Treatment Protocol


General
o Patient should be removed from the toxic environment immediately.
o These substances are very volatile, so there is little need for decontamination if
exposure was to vapor alone. If liquid was present, remove patient’s clothing;
wash liquid off skin.
o The effects of vapor from either form of cyanide appear within seconds to a
minute. If patient has no or only mild effects when seen 5 to 30 minutes after
exposure, he/she will need no treatment.
o Severe cyanide poisoning produces metabolic acidosis. If cyanide poisoning is
suspected in a patient who does not have moderate or severe acidosis,
treatment for cyanide poisoning should not be delayed, but the diagnosis should
be reconsidered

Patient evaluation (Level of consciousness, respiratory rate, heart rate)
o Exposure to high concentration: transient hyperpnea, followed by convulsions
(30 seconds after exposure), gradual decrease in respiratory rate and depth to
apnea (3‐5 minutes) and cessation of cardiac activity (5‐8 minutes).
o Exposure to lower concentration: flushing, headache, anxiety, agitation, vertigo,
feeling of weakness, nausea, muscular trembling (cyanogen chloride may cause
irritation of eyes, nose, and airways). Prolonged exposure may lead to effects
listed above.
o Odor of bitter almonds may be detected (half of the population cannot smell
this); normal pupils (may be dilated in terminal stage); cherry‐red skin (may not
be present); diaphoresis; venules in fundus are same color as arterioles; cyanosis
occurs only after circulatory collapse and apnea.
Treatment
o For a mild exposure (conscious and breathing): observe; no antidotes; oxygen
may be given to young or old or in presence of heart disease in a patient with
mild symptoms.
o Severe exposure (unconscious, not breathing): should immediately receive 100%
oxygen. Cardiac monitoring and evaluation of oxygen saturation should be done
when possible. (Saturation will be normal even in severe casualty until terminal
stage; however, additional oxygen may assist in therapy.) Antidotes should be
administered as soon as possible (see below). It is important to note that pulse
oximeter results are completely unreliable in the setting of methemoglobinemia,
which is induced by amyl nitrite or sodium nitrite therapy.
 For a severe exposure: ventilate using bag‐valve‐mask with one ampule
of amyl nitrite (crushed) in bag; after several minutes, add another
(crushed) ampule; keep adding an ampule every several minutes. This is a
temporary measure until IV drugs can be given, but it may assist in
recovery.
 Administer 300 mg (10 ml) of sodium nitrite IV over 5 minutes. Flush line.
[Children's dose: 0.2‐0.3 ml/kg, or 6‐9 mg/kg of the 3% solution. No
separate recommendation for infants.
 For elderly, use adult dose unless they are small and frail.] Be aware:
Nitrites produce orthostatic hypertension, but a patient who can stand
unaided does not need nitrite therapy.

Follow with 12.5 grams (50 ml) of sodium thiosulphate IV. [Children's
dose: 0.4 mg/kg, or 1.65 ml/kg of the 25% solution. No separate
recommendation for infants. Adult dose should be used for elderly unless
they are small and frail. Use care giving nitrite in a patient with
hypertension or heart disease.] (Amyl nitrite, sodium nitrite, and sodium
thiosulfate are in the Pasadena (formerly Lilly) Cyanide Antidote Kit, the
latter two in ampules of 300 mg/10 ml and 12.5 grams/50 ml. Use one‐
half dose in 20 minutes if no improvement. See instructions on top of
Antidote Kit box.
o If patient continues to remain apneic, intubate and continue oxygen through
tube with assisted ventilation.
o Transfer apneic or unconscious patients to medical facility.
o Patients often recover rapidly unless CNS hypoxia has occurred.
Methyl Isocyanate, Methylene, Bisphenyl Isocyanate, and Methylene Dilsocyanate MDI
Military Designations: None
Description: Methylene Bisphenyl Isocyanate (MDI) is found as a solid in white to yellow flakes.
Various liquid solutions are used for industrial purposes. There is no odor to the solid or the
liquid solutions. The vapor is approximately eight times heavier than air. This chemical is a
strong irritant to the eyes, mucus membranes, skin, and respiratory tract. This chemical is also a
very potent respiratory sensitizer.
Non‐Military Uses: Very large quantities of MDI are produced, transported, and used annually
in the United States. Various industrial processes utilize MDI in production and usage of
(poly)urethane foams, lacquers, and sealants. MDI is a commonly used precursor in the
industrial production of insecticides and laminating materials. Noncommercial uses of
polyurethanes such as in isocyanate paints or in cutting of uncured urethanes may also cause
exposure. Thermal degradation of these substances may produce MDI as a combustion by‐
product.

Treatment Protocol






General
o MDI is found as a solid, which has a melting point of 37 degrees C. Vapor
exposures occur with liquids containing dissolved solid. Gas exposures may occur
with high‐temperature volatilization. Thermal decomposition produces carbon
monoxide and oxides of nitrogen. Sensitivity to this substance (eye, nose
irritation) occurs at concentrations five times higher than OSHA limits (0.2
mglm3); hence toxic exposures may go unrecognized.
o Exposures lead to:
 Sensitizing effects: Respiratory sensitization may occur, particularly in
individuals with known asthma, allergies, or recognized isocyanate
sensitivity (e.g., TDI).
 Irritant effects: Eyes, mucous membranes and skin may be irritated,
particularly with prolonged, repetitive, or intense exposures. High
concentrations may also produce cough, dyspnea, and lethal pulmonary
edema.
Patient Evaluation
o Victim should be immediately removed from the toxic environment by personnel
in chemically protective clothing. Vapor or gas hazards should be anticipated
with full (positive pressure) masks. Liquid/solid contamination should be
corrected by clothing removal and soap and water decontamination.
Treatment
o Eyes: There is no specific therapy appropriate. Liquid/solid exposures should be
irrigated with copious quantities of water. Subsequently, symptomatic
individuals should seek medical attention.
o Skin: There is no specific therapy appropriate. Liquids/solids should be removed
with soap and water. Single exposures are unlikely to create rashes unless
previously sensitized. Intense exposure may produce a dermatitis and require
referral.
o Swallowing: Liquids/solids should be removed by induced vomiting in the
conscious victim or by lavage otherwise.
o Breathing: Symptoms due to sensitivity may be delayed up to 8 hr after
exposure. Respiratory symptoms may appear with skin, ocular or GI exposure in
previously sensitized individual.
 If apneic: CPR, may require intubation for pulmonary edema. Consider
severe bronchospasm in previously sensitized victim.
 If stridorous/hoarse: Consider intubation under direct vision.

If dyspnea/cough/chest tightness: Consider intubation for impending
pulmonary edema. Also consider possible bronchospasm sufficiently
severe to have so little air exchange that wheezes are absent. Medical
attention should be sought. Codeine‐containing demulcents may help. Be
wary of sedation.
 Note: The anatomical configuration of infants' and children's airways
makes wheezing a less reliable indicator of bronchospasm. Severe smaller
airway constriction with resultant hypoxia may be present. Any apparent
infant or child respiratory distress should be immediately assessed with
oximetry.
 If bronchospasm: Treat as asthma with inhaled albuterol. Bronchospasm
may be particularly severe, especially in previously sensitized individuals.
o Treat aggressively:
 Adults:
o Inhaled albuterol: unit dose q 2 hr or continuous neb 15 g/hr.
o Steroids: methylprednisolone load 250 mg IV, then 80 mg q 6 hr.
o Theophylline: load 150 mg IV, then 30 mg/hr.
 Infants and children (0‐12 yr.):
o Inhaled albuterol: 0.15 mg/kg per nebulized dose up to 5 mg/20
minutes for first 2 hr.
o Steroids: methylprednisolone; 1 mg/kg q 6 hr.
o Theophylline: 10 mg/kg IV/24 hr.
 Elderly:
o Inhaled albuterol: unit dose q 3 hr.
o Steroids: methylprednisolone load 125 mg IV, then 60 mg q 6 hr.
o Theophylline (occasional use): load 100 mg IV then 25 mg/hr.
o Upper airway obstruction: This is very rarely seen and only with intense
exposures. Hoarseness and stridor suggest impending laryngospasm; consider
intubation under direct vision.
 If pulmonary edema (may rarely occur with intense exposures): Treat as
non‐cardiac pulmonary edema (Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome or
ARDS see PHOSGENE).
 If hypoxia (commonly from bronchospasm, rarely from pulmonary
edema): Treat with above bronchodilation and oxygen.
 If cough: Codeine‐containing demulcents (tissue‐soothing agents) may
help. Be wary of sedation.

Mustard (Sulfur Mustard)
Military Designations: H; HD; HS
Description: Mustard is a “blister agent” that causes cell damage and destruction. It is a
colorless to light yellow to dark brown oily liquid with the odor of garlic, onion, or
mustard. It does not evaporate readily but may pose a vapor hazard in warm weather. It
is a vapor and liquid hazard to skin and eyes, and a vapor hazard to airways. Its vapor is
five times heavier than air.
Non‐Military Uses: Sulfur mustard has been used as a research tool to study DNA damage and
repair. A related compound, nitrogen mustard, was the first cancer chemotherapeutic
agent and is still used for some purposes.
Treatment Protocol




General
o Mustard causes no immediate effects. The initial clinical effects of mustard
(which usually involve the eyes, the skin, and the airways) appear 2 to 24 hours
(usually 4 to 8 hours) after exposure to liquid mustard or to mustard vapor.
However, liquid or vapor mustard penetrates the skin and mucous membranes
and damages cells within minutes of exposure, so decontamination must be
done immediately after exposure.
o The patient should be immediately removed from the toxic environment.
o If liquid contact, clothing should be removed, and skin decontaminated with
soap and cool water, or thoroughly flushed with water alone. Eyes should be
flushed with large amounts of saline. If exposure is to vapor alone, remove
clothing.
o If there is a history of definite exposure, patient should be taken to medical
facility for observation.
Patient evaluation: Initial effects (usually 2 to 24 hours after exposure)
o Eyes: irritation, feeling of grit in eye, redness.
o Skin: erythema (will progress to blisters 1 to 4 hours later if exposure was large).
o Airways: irritation of nose, voice change, sinus pain, hacking cough. (Very rarely a
patient might inhale an extremely large amount and start to have these effects
plus dyspnea within 2 hours. This patient should be intubated, and assisted
ventilation with oxygen should be started. This patient should be taken to the
nearest appropriate hospital as quickly as possible.)

Page 10 of 13

Treatment
o There is nothing to do for these patients until effects appear except to
decontaminate. Tissue is damaged within minutes, so decontamination must be
done immediately.
o Eyes: Any commercial eye solution may relieve the irritation from a mild
exposure. More severe effects: A mydriatic b.i.d. or q.i.d. (depending on the
length of action of the drug): a topical antibiotic b.i.d.; Vaseline on lid edges
b.i.d.; sunglasses if photophobia is present. Topical steroids within the first 24
hours only may reduce inflammation. Control pain with systemic, not topical,
analgesics. Visual loss is usually due to lid edema and blepharospasm, not eye
damage.
o Skin: A soothing lotion (e.g., calamine) for erythema. Leave small blisters intact.
Unroof large blisters and irrigate denuded area at least t.i.d. followed by liberal
application of topical antibiotic. Watch for infection. Fluid requirements are
much less than those for thermal burns; do not overhydrate.
o Airways: Steam inhalation and cough suppressants will generally relieve mild
symptoms. A chemical pneumonitis (increased temperature, white blood count;
chest x‐ray findings) may develop after large exposure: intubation, assisted
ventilation with oxygen (and possibly with PEEP or CPAP); bronchodilators;
watch sputum at least daily for organisms (no antibiotics until organism is
identified)
o Systemic absorption of a large amount of mustard may cause bone marrow and
gastrointestinal tract damage. Watch WBC, Hct daily; mustard damages bone
marrow.

Nerve Agents
Tabun (GA); Sarin (GB); Soman (GD). None for GF and VX
Military Designations: GA, GB, GD, GF and VX
Description: Nerve agents are very toxic organophosphorus compounds that have biological
activity similar to that of many insecticides. Their volatilities range from that of water to that of
motor oil; they present a hazard from vapor and liquid. Under temperate conditions, the liquids
are clear, colorless, and mostly odorless. They cause biological effects by inhibiting
acetylcholinesterase, thereby allowing acetylcholine to accumulate and cause hyperactivity in
muscles, glands, and nerves.

Page 11 of 13

Non‐Military Use: There is no non‐military use. Threat of human exposure exists in research
laboratories, in storage facilities, and from terrorists.
Treatment Protocol




General
o Nerve agents are extremely toxic chemicals that cause effects by inhibiting the
enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing excess acetylcholine to accumulate. This
excess neurotransmitter then produces overstimulation and causes hyperactivity
in muscles, glands and nerves the nerve agents are GA (Tabun), GB (Sarin), GD
(Soman), GF, and VX. Their effects are identical.
o Remove patient from contaminated atmosphere. If exposure was to vapor,
remove clothing; if exposure was to liquid; remove clothing and wash skin with
soap and water, or thoroughly flush with water alone.
Patient evaluation
o If patient is conscious, note ventilatory status and ask about nausea. If
unconscious, note ventilatory status and heart rate (heart rate may be high, low,
or normal in a nerve agent casualty).
o Initial effects differ depending on whether exposure was to vapor or to liquid.
o Vapor: Effects start within seconds to a minute or two.
 Mild to moderate: Miosis, possible redness in eye, eye pain, complaints
of dim or blurred vision, nausea, rhinorrhea, excess secretions, dyspnea
(mild to severe).
 Severe: Loss of consciousness, seizures, apnea, flaccid paralysis.
o Liquid: Effects start in minutes (large exposure) to 18 hours (small exposure)
after an asymptomatic interval.
 Mild to moderate: Sweating and fasciculations at site of exposure;
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; weakness.
 Severe: Same as for vapor, but after a 1‐ to 30‐minute asymptomatic
interval.

Treatment
o Initial Management
 Mild to moderate: Dyspnea should be treated with one or two doses of
atropine IM or IV and 1 dose of pralidoxime (IV drip) initially, depending
on severity of the dyspnea. (See paragraph B below for size of dose.) This
should be supplemented with oxygen, particularly in infants, young
children, and the elderly; healthy older children and adults will usually do
well without it unless they have pulmonary or cardiac disease. Atropine
dose should be repeated at 5‐to 10‐minute intervals until improvement is
noted. Failure to respond, (i.e., no dry mouth, no decrease in secretions)
confirms the need to administer additional doses of atropine.
Gastrointestinal effects after liquid exposure are treated in the same
manner. Do not treat for miosis (unless eye pain is severe) or rhinorrhea
(unless severe).
 Severe: Administer three doses of atropine IM (not IV in hypoxic patient)
and start one dose of pralidoxime by slow (20 minutes) IV drip. (More
rapid administration will cause hypertension.) (See paragraph B below for
size of dose.) Intubate and ventilate with oxygen (initial ventilation will be
difficult because of airway resistance; atropine will relieve this).
Administer diazepam if convulsing. Suction for secretions. Repeat 1 dose
of atropine (IM until hypoxia is improved, then IV) every 5 minutes until
(a) secretions diminish or (b) airway resistance is less or is normal. Failure
to respond, ( i.e., no dry mouth, no decrease in secretions) confirms the
need to administer additional doses of atropine. Monitor via pulse
oximeter; cardiac monitoring should also be done (cardiac arrhythmias
are uncommon after atropine is given). Acidosis may develop after
seizures or after period of hypoxia and will require therapy. This patient
should be transported to a hospital after stabilization (adequate drug
therapy and initiation of ventilation).
 Eyes: Do not treat miosis unless eye/head pain is severe. Use topical, not
systemic, anticholinergic to relieve pain.
o Recommended Doses
Atropine:
 Older child and adult: 2 mg
 Infant and young child: 0.02 mg/kg
 Elderly: Use adult dose unless cardiac or pulmonary disease is present, or
patient is small or frail; in latter instances, use 1 mg as standard, but be
prepared to administer additional amounts more frequently.

Page 13 of 13

Pralidoxime (2‐PAM):
 Older child and adult: 1 gram
 Infant and young child: 25‐50 mg/kg
 Elderly: Adult dose unless cardiac or renal disease is present, patient has
hypertension, or patient is small and frail; decrease dose by half in these
patients but administer the other half 1 hour later if patient has not
improved. Pralidoxime can cause hypertension when given rapidly IV.
Slow administration over 20 minutes will minimize the hypertensive
effect. After rapid administration, hypertension can be rapidly but
transiently reversed by phentolamine (adult: 5 mg IV. child: 1 mg, IV).
o Further Care
 Mild to moderate: After vapor exposure, a patient who is breathing
normally does not need to be hospitalized as he will not worsen.
However, miosis should be followed until eyes are normal (4 to 6 weeks).
After liquid exposure, a patient should be observed in hospital for 18
hours until all agent is absorbed from skin.
 Severe: Continue to ventilate and to administer atropine following
guidelines above. Treat acidosis if present. If patient has not had
prolonged hypoxia, recovery of an unconscious patient will be gradual
over l to 3 hours.
