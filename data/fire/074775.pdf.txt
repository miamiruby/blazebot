DISPATCH POLICY
The Phoenix Fire Department will respond to any EMERGENCY situation that threatens LIFE, SAFETY or
PROPERTY. In cases where the fire department is not the appropriate agency or not capable of delivering the
needed assistance, or if the situation is not a true emergency, an attempt will be made to place the caller in
contact with the appropriate provider. The fire department will dispatch the closest available unit(s) with the
required capabilities to control the emergency. The judgment of both Phoenix Fire Department Regional
Dispatch Center (PFDRDC) and emergency response personnel is an integral part of the decision making
process, taking into consideration both the information received and the potential that exists.
Timely response and effective management of EMS, rescue and fire control situations represent the most
immediate priorities of the fire department. Upon receipt of adequate or additional information (location,
telephone callback and nature of the emergency), Deployment will dispatch the appropriate assignment and
upgrade the response as necessary based on information received up to a Working First Alarm until command
is established upon the arrival of the first unit.
JURISDICTION
Emergency incidents within the Automatic Aid boundaries served by the PFDRDC will be dispatched without
regard to jurisdiction. Units will also be dispatched to borderline locations when Deployment personnel cannot
make accurate determination of the jurisdiction.
PFDRDC has enhanced mutual aid with Rural/Metro Fire Department (RMFD) within one (1) mile of the
borders of Scottsdale and Phoenix in the Northeast portion of the Valley. Rural/Metro units and Automatic Aid
Consortium units can be dispatched into these areas without prior approval when the CAD system recognizes
a RMFD unit is closer in these areas.
PFDRDC has enhanced mutual aid for requests by Gila River Indian Community Fire Department for incidents
that occur on I10 from Phoenix city limits to mile post 169; within two and one-half (2.5) miles from the border
of the Gila River Indian Community and the cities of Chandler and Phoenix in Maricopa County; within one (1)
mile of the border of the Gila River Indian Community, the City of Chandler, and the Sun Lakes Fire Districts in
Pinal County.
PFDRDC has one (1) way Automatic Aid onto Luke Air Force Base (LAFB). CAD has been programmed to
select LAFB units for any calls that fall within a five (5) mile radius of the base. CAD will also select the next
available unit to respond.
Calls for assistance from public or quasi-public agencies outside the Automatic Aid Consortium boundaries will
be dispatched as Mutual Aid incidents with the approval of the individual jurisdiction’s on-duty BC or the onduty Phoenix Fire Department Shift Commander if Phoenix resources are needed.
Calls for assistance from citizens outside the Automatic Aid Consortium boundaries will be transferred to the
appropriate agency. If that agency requests Mutual Aid assistance, PFDRDC will contact the appropriate
jurisdiction for approval of the Mutual Aid request and dispatch accordingly.

CALL ROUTING
Determination of the nature of the problem may indicate that a caller does not have an emergency that
requires a fire department response. The identification, prevention and reduction of unnecessary responses
are basic parts of the Deployment function. The call routing process must not delay response to valid
emergency incidents but should attempt to verify the nature of questionable calls. When a positive
determination of need for emergency response cannot be made THE FIRE DEPARTMENT POLICY IS TO
DISPATCH.
CALLTAKER
The primary responsibility of the Calltaker is to determine, without delay, the location, telephone callback and
nature of the emergency and to verify entry of the incident into the CAD system.
NATURE CODES
The Calltaker assigns a Nature Code based on information gathered from the caller. Once the Calltaker enters
the incident for dispatch, the CAD system selects available units by capability and proximity to fulfill the
response requirements of the assignment. Automatic Aid Consortium members have the ability to modify
response types for each Nature Code on file. The Phoenix Fire Department attempts to streamline this
process and works to maintain consistency however; the Phoenix Fire Department understands that some
variations are needed to meet the specific needs of the jurisdictions.
UNIT SELECTION
The CAD system recommends the closest, most appropriate unit/s/ for dispatch based on availability, current
location and capabilities. The CAD system combines this information with the response type.
A response type is assigned to each Nature Code. The response type identifies the requirements needed on
the assignment. Requirements can be identified by unit capability, such as engine or ladder, or by specific
unit, such as BC2. Requirements are also expressed as primary or secondary. A unit can fulfill only one
primary requirement. A unit can fulfill more than one secondary requirement.
When an incident is selected for dispatch, the CAD system builds an ordered unit consideration list. As a unit
is considered for dispatch, its capabilities are inventoried against the outstanding response requirements. If it
can satisfy any outstanding requirement it is added to the recommendation. The CAD system will continue to
add units to the recommendation until all response requirements have been satisfied or all units have been
exhausted. Some unit capabilities have distance limitations added to requirements. The system will not send
certain types of units if they are out of the predetermined response range.
RESPONSE ASSIGNMENTS
The Calltaker makes initial determination of the appropriate Nature Code based on information received from
the caller. Individual jurisdictions may customize the primary and secondary response requirements on a given
Nature Code. CAD will automatically dispatch the required units per Nature Code entered for each jurisdiction.
The RSPREQ command may be utilized to determine the specific primary and secondary response
requirements per Nature Code for an individual jurisdiction:
Format:
Example:

RSPREQ Nature Code, Jurisdiction Code (3 letters)
RSPREQ STR1A, PHX

ALS Medical Calls
The requirements for ALS response are based on Emergency Medical Dispatch protocol (EMD).

Page 3 of 16

BLS Medical Calls
All medical calls are triaged using EMD protocols. On BLS responses the Company Officer will make a C2 or
C3 response decision and press the appropriate response on the MCT. If the response is modified and sent
as ALS when the caller provides additional information that meets the ALS criterion, the calls defaults to C3.
The ALS response criterion is different for each Nature Code.
Minor Medical Calls
The patient has to meet the following criteria; no loss of consciousness, peripheral injuries only, head/face;
arm: below elbow; leg: below knee, no trunk injuries, no impaled objects, no amputations, no severe bleeding.
Violent Medical Calls
The incident has been determined unsafe to respond directly to the scene. Units assigned to the incident shall
stage until the Police Department secures the scene.
Airport Incidents
The alert classifications of aircraft emergencies are distinguished by the Federal Aviation Administration to
describe an unsafe condition or situation involving an aircraft. The Fire Department Captain from Station 19
will identify the appropriate ARFF assignment to be dispatched on any aircraft emergency at Sky Harbor
Airport. The default assignment to Sky Harbor Airport is ARF2-1.
Fire Incidents
Incidents that require or potentially require water capabilities to extinguish a fire.
Fire Incidents (3-1's)
A 3-1 assignment will be dispatched for structure fires that do not indicate the need for a First Alarm
assignment.
Fire Incidents - First Alarms
A First Alarm will be dispatched for structure fires when reports indicate this level of resource are needed.
This may be based on reports that indicate an actual or potential situation. A First Alarm may be dispatched
for other types of incidents at the discretion of Dispatch personnel.
Brush Fires
Brush assignments will be dispatched for reported vegetation fires. A Still Brush assignment will be dispatched
for vegetation fires that are small in nature. A Brush assignment will be dispatched for vegetation fires that are
serious in nature. A First Alarm Brush assignment will be dispatched for vegetation fires that are and/or have
the potential to be a major situation requiring this level of resources.
Hazardous Materials
Hazardous Materials assignments will be dispatched for incidents reported to involve hazardous materials.
Hazardous Materials situations MAY include fire, spills, transportation accidents, chemical reactions,
explosions and/or similar events. Hazards may include toxicity, flammability, radiological hazards, chemical
reactions and/or combinations of factors.

Hazardous Materials cont’d
A HAZ assignment will be dispatched on calls that involve hazardous materials of a minor nature. A HAZ2-1
assignment should be dispatched on most situations involving leaks or spills of hazardous materials. This
includes situations that appear to be manageable and do not create a major risk to the public by virtue of
location, amount or type of hazard. A HAZ1A assignment should be dispatched for incidents that indicate a
major potential danger by virtue of materials involved, quantities, location, fire or explosion danger and/or
number of people exposed.
Technical Rescue
Incidents that may require specialized equipment and training to extricate the patient(s). These incidents
include confined space rescue, trench rescue, high angle or rope rescue, water rescue, structural collapse,
mountain and tree rescues.
Service Calls and Other Miscellaneous Incidents
Service Calls will also be dispatched for non-emergency situations. Deployment will select the appropriate
Nature Code that best describes the situation. Some service calls require the Calltaker to determine a C2
or C3 response.
SUPPLEMENTAL DISPATCH
Depending on the resources required additional units may be dispatched to an incident in several methods.
Units can be Special Called, an assignment can be Balanced or a Greater Alarm can be requested.
Special Call
A Special Call is a request for the dispatch of any combination of additional unit types, unit capabilities or
specific units. The requestor must specify the desired quantity of unit types or capabilities or the specific units
desired.
When formulating a recommendation for a special call, no consideration is given to the units already assigned
to the incident. All response requirements for the special call request are satisfied by the recommendation of
additional units.
Balance of Assignment
A balance of assignment is a request for the dispatch of the additional units necessary to upgrade the
response type. Either the desired response type or a specific Nature Code must be specified. If a Nature
Code is specified, the CAD system will determine the response type based on the specified Nature Code and
the jurisdiction in which the incident is located.
When formulating a recommendation for a Balance of an assignment, the CAD system first determines which
response requirements for the new response type are satisfied by the units that are already assigned to the
incident. The CAD system then recommends additional units to satisfy any outstanding response requirement.
Greater Alarm
A Greater Alarm is a request for the dispatch of additional units using predefined requirement sets. A Greater
Alarm request requires both a Greater Alarm Type and the Response Level.

PHOENIX REGIONAL
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

COMMUNICATIONS
M.P. 205.01

10/10-R

Page 5 of 16

Greater Alarm cont’d
When formulating a recommendation for a Greater Alarm, no consideration is given to the units already
assigned to the incident. The Response Level indicated satisfies all response requirements for the Greater
Alarm. Assignments should be balanced up to and including a Working First Alarm. When an assignment is
Balanced, the system takes into consideration the units currently assigned to the incident. Therefore, an
incident can go from a single engine response, such as a tree fire and be Balanced to a Working First Alarm
allowing the system to fulfill all requirements necessary for the Working First Alarm. This however does not
occur for Greater Alarms. A 3-1 assignment that needs the resources of a Greater Alarm must first be
Balanced to a Working Fire Alarm then the Greater Alarm request must be generated.
Response Levels do not have to be equivalent to Alarm Levels, however, often times they are. The response
level requested for a Greater Alarm request should reflect the level of resources required, not necessarily the
next alarm level.
Example:

An incident may be a Third Alarm Structure and may require the components of a Hazardous
Assignment. The assumption is to ask for a Fourth Alarm Hazardous. If, however, a Fourth Alarm
Hazardous were requested, no Hazardous Materials capabilities would be added to the
assignment. At this point, a Second Alarm Hazardous must be requested.

Specific Types of Second Alarms
Second Alarms are dispatched at the request of command, when the need is indicated. Command should ask
for the specific type alarm needed to continue managing the incident: If a First Alarm Brush is being used and
Command wants to provide relief for crews, Command should call for a Second Alarm Rehab.
The following are valid codes for Greater Alarms:
BRUSH
HAZMAT
HIRISE
MED
REHAB
RESCUE
STRUCT
STRMED

BRUSH ASSIGNMENT
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ASSIGNMENT
HIRISE ASSIGNMENT
MEDICAL ASSIGNMENT
REHAB ASSIGNMENT
RESCUE ASSIGNMENT
STRUCTURAL ASSIGNMENT
STRUCTURAL/MED

Greater Alarms
Third Alarms and greater still require a specific type of alarm to be requested; however the capabilities
recommended will be generic and are the same for each Greater Alarms up to a Ninth Alarm.
DISPATCH CHANNEL 1
The Channel 1 dispatcher is responsible for reviewing the unit/s/ suggested for dispatch by the CAD system.
The dispatcher may modify the unit selection based on additional information or circumstantial factors.
The dispatcher transmits the call to the assigned units by depressing the DISPATCH button, sending the
information to the Fire Station Packages and Mobile Computer Terminals (MCTs).

Normal Dispatch
The voice dispatch message is broadcast over Fire Channel 1 giving:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Dispatch Tone
Companies Assigned
Tactical Radio Channel
Type and/or Nature of Incident
Location
Companies Assigned
Tactical Radio Channel

DURING PERIODS OF HIGH ACTIVITY THE DISPATCH MESSAGE MAY BE MODIFIED TO ADVISE UNITS
TO CHECK MCT's FOR DISPATCH.
Immediate Dispatch
Specific high priority Nature Codes are flagged for Immediate Dispatch upon incident entry. Additionally,
Calltakers have the ability to cause any incident to be dispatched immediately upon entry in the CAD system.
During an Immediate Dispatch the station terminals and MCT's will receive the dispatch information as soon as
the Calltaker enters the call. The Voice Dispatch will occur when the call is processed through Channel 1. The
time elapsing between Station Alerting and Voice Dispatch will depend upon the level of activity at the dispatch
position.
Working Incident Notifications
Deployment will sound the ALL CALL tone and make a general announcement over Dispatch Channel 1 of the
following incidents:
• Working First Alarm fires
• Greater Alarms
• At the discretion of the on-duty Deployment BC and/or Supervisor
Change of Status
All companies are in either in an AVAILABLE or UNAVAILABLE status at all times. The status refers to the
company's availability to accept a dispatch. Units assigned to an incident are considered UNAVAILABLE until
released. The exception to this is during AOI calls; see ‘Responding’ section for further details.
Units that are Available on Radio (AOR) or Available Out of Vehicle (AOV) shall monitor Channel 1.
Units changing their status to UNAVAILABLE should report to Deployment by radio on Tactical Channel 2 or
telephone the reason and the length of time they will be unavailable. When becoming available again, units
are responsible to report this status change to Deployment.
It is important that company officers contact Deployment prior to putting their unit unavailable. Deployment will
determine if any priority needs exist which may require the unit to stay in service.
MOVE-UP POLICY
The on-duty Deployment Supervisor/Battalion Chief is responsible for relocating units as necessary to maintain
the best available resource coverage for the entire dispatch jurisdictional coverage area. This responsibility
includes the authority to request companies from the Automatic Aid Consortium and to control or cancel
scheduled and non-scheduled non-emergency activities. NOTE: Members assigned to Adaptive Response
units should refer to M.P. 205.09 Adaptive Response Units.

MOVE-UP POLICY cont’d
Moved-up companies retain their normal identity ("Engine 14 out of Station 30").
The need for move-up companies will be evaluated whenever:
•
•
•
•
•
•

A working fire is declared.
Three (3) or more units are committed to an incident in an outlying area.
Greater Alarms are dispatched.
Simultaneous working incidents occur in one area of the City.
Coverage in an area is compromised.
Two (2) or more adjacent first due areas will be uncovered for more than 30 minutes.

Move-ups will be C2 unless advised to respond C3 due to a critical gap in coverage.
If overall coverage in the City of Phoenix falls below 12 engine companies and three (3) ladder companies,
Deployment will immediately notify the South Shift Commander who has the responsibility to authorize the
recall of off duty personnel to staff reserve companies if necessary.
TACTICAL RADIO OPERATOR (TRO)
The TRO handles all communications between units assigned to an incident and Deployment on the assigned
Tactical Channel. All units responding to an incident shall switch to the assigned channel immediately after
dispatch.
Self Dispatch
Units may add themselves to an incident by an AU function on their MCT. Companies adding on to an
assignment must advise the TRO on the assigned Tactical Channel if they are substituting for another unit or
responding in addition to the original assignment. The TRO will cancel the original unit dispatched if the
substituting unit is closer to the scene.
The TRO will advise the Command Officer of units responding in addition to the dispatched assignment. The
updated dispatch message will be transmitted to all responding units via MCT.
Acknowledgement
All units responding to an incident shall acknowledge dispatch by radio on the assigned tactical channel or by
Mobile Computer Terminal (MCT).
If Deployment does not receive an acknowledgment within one (1) minute, the TRO will request
acknowledgment by radio on all channels and via MCT.
Deployment will send a cover assignment if no reply is received within a two (2) minute timeframe.
Deployment will continue to attempt to make contact with the original company while the cover unit is
responding. If unable to contact the original unit, the company will be placed unavailable and the appropriate
Battalion Chief notified of the circumstances.

Responding
All fire and ALS EMS responses will be C3 unless otherwise indicated by Deployment or Command. Units
responding to calls on the freeways will proceed C2. BLS Nature Codes will be dispatched without a C2 or C3
response flag. The company officer will make the determination to respond after reviewing the dispatch
information. Minor medical incidents and some service calls will be dispatched C2/Available on Incident (AOI).
The AOI feature allows a company assigned to a low priority incident to be preempted for a higher priority call if
they are the closest unit. This occurs automatically on pre-identified AOI type calls and when a unit is in a
responding mode.
If the company officer makes the decision to respond C2 on a C3 call, he/she must advise his/her TRO or
press C2 on his/her MCT and send. Similarly, if the company officer makes the decision to respond C3 on a
C2 call, he/she must advise his/her TRO or press C3 on his/her MCT and send.
A unit dispatched on a C2 AOI call will automatically become AOI after acknowledging response to the initial
call. After acknowledgement they will remain AOI until they arrive on the scene. If a unit is responding longer
than ten (10) minutes on an AOI call, CAD will automatically place the unit in the Unavailable On Incident (UOI)
status, and they will no longer be considered for preemption. Once a unit places themselves on-scene of an
incident, they are no longer considered available for dispatches until they return to an available status.
•

If a company officer determines they do not want to be AOI while responding, they may indicate they
are traveling C3 to the incident via radio or MCT. If the company officer determines they do not want to
be AOI while responding C2 to the incident, they may use the MCT command UOI. This command will
show the unit responding C2 however the unit will not be available for preemption.

•

Once a company arrives on-scene of an incident and have determined they could leave the call
promptly to take another call, they can place themselves AOI again either via radio or MCT.

While responding, companies may communicate with one another if radio traffic permits. Effective
communications during this period can set the stage for effective action and improve the overall rescue and fire
attack effort. Factors such as occupancy hazards, access, traffic conditions and response routes may be
communicated.
Company officers should review tactical information on their MCT, map books and any pre-fire planning
information carried on the vehicle for specific tactical information. Subsequent arriving units should monitor
radio traffic to be fully informed of the situation based on reports of the first arriving units.
Additional Information / Subsequent Calls
The TRO will relay any additional information gained from subsequent calls as soon as possible. Additional
information and updates will be transmitted to the MCTs of all responding units.
Companies needing specific additional information shall request it from the TRO.

On-scene Reports
The first fire department member or unit to arrive at the scene of a multiple unit response shall assume
command of the incident*. The initial Incident Commander shall remain in Command until Command is
transferred or the incident is stabilized and Command is terminated.
•

One or two company responses that are not going to escalate beyond the commitment of these
companies do not require the first arriving unit or officer to assume Command. The first arriving unit or
officer will, however remain responsible for any needed Command functions. Examples would include:
 Single unit response Check Welfare
 Check Hazard
 Any EMS call requiring only one or two companies

The first arriving fire department unit initiates the command process by giving an initial radio report.
The standard Initial Radio Report includes:
On-Scene Report
1. Clear alarm.
2. Unit designation/on the scene.
3. Building/area description.
Occupancy
Size (large, medium, small)
Height (assumed 1 story unless reported otherwise)
4. Obvious problem/conditions.
Nothing showing (indicates checking)
Smoke showing (amount and location)
Fire showing (amount and location)
Working fire
Fully involved
5. Action taken.
Assuming command
Laying a line
Attacking with…etc.
6. Declaration of Strategy.

Command
Once command has been established, all routine communication between Deployment and an incident will be
directed through Command.
Progress Reports
During active firefighting operations, Command will provide Deployment with regular progress reports or
whenever significant tactical plans are changed or unusual situations are encountered. The first progress
report should be given after initial action has been implemented and should include the correct address and an
improved description of the building and fire conditions if the arrival report was incomplete. This assists
Deployment in making move-up decisions. The TRO will repeat significant facts from all progress reports for
the information of monitoring units and document in the incident history.
Working Fire
The term Working Fire indicates a situation that will require the commitment of all responding companies. This
report advises Deployment that the companies will be engaged in tactical activities and will be held at the
scene for an extended period of time.
When notified of a Working 3-1, Deployment will:
1. Dispatch a Working Fire assignment (WF)
2. Address the need for a Fire Investigator.
3. Dispatch PD for traffic and crowd control.
4. Dispatch appropriate gas and electric companies.
5. Change the status to a Working Fire, which starts elapsed time notifications.
6. Make move-ups to affected area
7. Document progress reports, sectors, assignments, emergency traffic, and elapsed time notifications
and append additional information provided from Deployment members in the Incident History.
When notified of a Working First Alarm, Deployment will:
1. Dispatch a Working Fire assignment (WF1A)
2. Isolate tactical channel
3. Dispatch a Fire Investigator
4. Dispatch PD for traffic and crowd control
5. Dispatch gas and electric companies
6. Make move-ups to affected area
7. Document progress reports, Sectors/Divisions/Groups, assignments, emergency traffic, and elapsed
time notifications and append additional information provided from Deployment members in the Incident
History.
8. Be prepared to assign a TRO to monitor/work Staging and Safety Sectors/Divisions channels.
9. Be prepared to dispatch further assistance.
10. Be prepared to dispatch any special agencies or equipment when the need is indicated.
11. Make notifications to pertinent personnel.
Deployment will monitor radio traffic on all incidents to anticipate the needs of Command.
Any fire at a school facility requires the State Fire Marshall to be contacted. The on-duty State Fire Marshall
will use his/her discretion as to response.

Staging
Units arriving in Staging will depress the "STG" key on their MCT. If assigned to a sector or task on the
fireground the "ON-SCENE" key shall be depressed.
Units arriving in Level I Staging will report their identity and direction from the scene on the assigned Tactical
Channel.
Upon the balance of a working Second Alarm assignment, Level II Staging will be identified by Command.
Deployment will announce Level II staging location and the staging channel when the additional units are
dispatched. Units responding should direct any staging inquiries to the Staging channel, rather than the
Tactical channel assigned to the incident. Typically Staging will be assigned to Channel 2. The driver of the
CV will coordinate information on the Staging channel until an officer assumes the position of the Staging
Officer. Units arriving at the Level II Staging Area will report in person to the Staging Officer. The Staging
Officer will manage all radio communications to and from the Staging Area.
Incident Status & Milestones
The following are the different incident status changes that need to be indicated: Working Fire (WF), Working
Haz Mat (WHZ), Working Technical Rescue (WTR), Code (CO), or Major Medical (MM). When one (1) of
these incidents are identified by command, the TRO will enter a specific command. For Working Fire and
Working Haz Mat incidents, this change will prompt ELAPSED TIME NOTIFICATIONS. The system will
generate an elapsed time notification every five (5) minutes until the incident is placed Under Control. The
TRO will verbally provide command with elapsed time notifications until the situation is declared under control
or Command requests to discontinue notifications. Elapsed Time Notifications will also be documented in the
Incident History.
The following are the definitions of the Incident Milestones:
906: Fire unit/s/ need immediate police department assistance.
All Clear (AC): Can be used on a fire or medical incident. On fire calls an All Clear indicates the fire
building and all exposures have been searched and all civilians evacuated. In the case of a building that
is well involved in fire, the All Clear may be delayed and not come until the fire is out. For medical calls, it
indicates the patient has been extricated. It is used most commonly when patients have been trapped as
a result of an automobile accident or during a water or mountain rescue when the patient has been
removed from the endangered area.
CO Below 50ppm (CO): Level of carbon monoxide is below 50 parts per million, units may operate
without SCBA protection.
Command Terminated (CT): There is no longer a single person in charge of the incident.
Communications can be held with anyone still on the scene.
Command Terminated (XCM) – Also referred to as Cancel Command. There is no longer a single person
in charge of the incident. This milestone is used after CT and removed the Command designator from the
unit.
Defensive (DEF): Units operating in the defensive strategy.
Emergency Traffic (ETT): Emergency Traffic has been declared on an incident

RETURNING COMPANIES
Only Command can release companies assigned to an incident. Command will indicate the units to "HOLD" at
the scene, report the nature of the actual situation found and release the remainder of the assignment. The
TRO will repeat this report from Command and document the “HOLD” command in the incident history.
Returning units will be responsible for placing their unit in an AOR status when available.
SECTORS/DIVISIONS/GROUPS
NOTE: Sectors may be assigned by their geographic location (North Sector) or function (Ventilation Sector).
Divisions are assigned by their geographic location (North Division). Groups are assigned by their function
(Ventilation Group). For the remainder of this MP we will refer to Sectors with the understanding that either
Divisions or Groups may be used where appropriate.
Sector Officers should use face-to-face communications with assigned companies as much as possible, but
should keep Command informed of progress via radio on any problems encountered and significant progress.
Command may assign Sector Officer’s FITs to a designated Safety Channel when desired to enhance overall
scene safety.
CAD SECTOR COMMANDS
The TRO should ensure that each unit that is assigned to a Sector is documented using the Sector
Commands. The TRO will enter the appropriate command to designate a Sector Officer (SECTO), a Sector
Member (SECTM) or to remove a unit from a sector (SECTX). Using these commands allows both the TRO
and Incident Commander to track the assignment of units during the incident. The TRO can designate a sector
ID of up to six (6) alphanumeric characters.
Example: SECTO E3 INTER or SECTM E2 INTER
STAFF
Staff members with fireground responsibilities will respond to Greater Alarms for assistance with various sector
functions. Staff members will report in person to the Command Post and will automatically assume sector
duties in their area of responsibility unless ordered otherwise.
Communications from staff personnel should be with command as much as possible; however, there will be
situations that require direct communications with sector officers. Staff communications should be face to face
as much as possible.
An isolated Tactical Channel will be assigned by Deployment for each incident where applicable. Command
may also request a "Clear Channel" for a working incident. When requested, Deployment will direct units on
other incidents to an alternate Tactical Channel.

ORDER MODEL
Radio communications will be regulated by the following order model guidelines.
1.
2.
3.
4.

Sender will give unit ID and call the receiver by their unit ID.
Receiver will give their ID to indicate they are ready to receive.
Sender will then extend message, order, etc.
Receiver will give ID and acknowledge receipt of message. A brief restatement is the best
acknowledgment.
5. Deployment will acknowledge all communications directed to it by a brief restatement of the message,
with particular attention given to repeating on the scene, size-up and progress reports, recall reports,
requests for additional resource and all Incident Status changes and milestones.
MAY DAY
"May Day" is a term to be used only in the event of a lost or trapped firefighter. (See “May Day”
Communications for further details.) A well-defined communications structure is essential in any rescue
operation. Deployment will play a crucial role in ensuring the effective rescue of firefighters.
EMERGENCY TRAFFIC
The term ‘Emergency Traffic’ will be utilized by any unit encountering an immediately perilous situation and will
receive the highest communications priority from Deployment, Command and all operating units. Units may
initiate emergency communications by depressing the red emergency button on their portable radio, MCT, or
by verbally contacting Deployment.
EXAMPLE: ‘L11 to Alarm with Emergency Traffic’. Deployment will immediately activate the Emergency
Traffic tone. The unit will transmit his/her message. Deployment will repeat message one (1)
time and document in the Incident History.
If Deployment does not acknowledge Emergency Traffic the unit should then establish contact with Command
and transmit the emergency message. Command will then re-initiate the Emergency Traffic sequence with
Deployment.
WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE AIR BELONGS TO ANY UNIT WITH ‘EMERGENCY TRAFFIC’
UNIT DESIGNATION
For radio communications, the following designations will be recognized as standard:
Dispatch & Deployment
Officer of any unit
Engineer of any pumper
Engineer of any ladder
Firefighter on any unit
Battalion Chiefs
Battalion Field Incident Technician
Shift Commander

RADIO CODE
"Plain language" radio messages should be used in preference to numerical codes to facilitate understanding.
There is no official Phoenix Fire Department radio code. This is also in compliance with NIMS.
The following code messages (from the Police radio code) may be used in sensitive situations, when a plain
language message could cause a problem at the scene:
261
901-H
906
961
962
963

Rape
Dead body
Need Police assistance IMMEDIATELY
Vehicle accident, no injuries
Vehicle accident, with injuries
Vehicle accident with fatality

RADIO PROCEDURE
Short-specific
Before transmitting know what you are going to say. Choose precise terms to communicate the desired
message as clearly and briefly as possible without wasting airtime.
Task Oriented/Company Oriented
Command’s orders to operating companies should indicate a specific task assigned to the company. They
should be of a magnitude reasonably performed by a single company alone or in concert with other
companies.
Indicate Objective
In addition to being task and company oriented, assignments should indicate an objective to the action. The
company should know exactly where to go, to whom to report, what is the task and what is the objective of the
task. Orders should tell what to do - not how to do it (unless Command wants something specific).
Clear Tone/Self Control Effective Rate
Speak clearly at a practiced rate. Not too fast and not too slow. Control your emotions and excitement
deliberately. If you do not consciously control your voice, it will become garbled under stress.
Well Timed/Spaced
Prioritize your messages. Do not use valuable airtime with unimportant messages and insignificant details.
Maintain an awareness of the overall situation and your role in it.
Do not interrupt conversations unless you have Emergency Traffic. Listen before transmitting and wait until a
message transaction has been completed.
Pause between consecutive messages. This will make it clear when one message has been completed and
another started. It also allows other units to break in with urgent/emergent traffic if applicable.
